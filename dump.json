Well fear no more, because I've accidentally grown enough parsley to make garlic bread for the entire United Kingdom (incidentally, can you do anything else with parsley? Please. I have so much parsley.)\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n        <p>\r\n            Like everyone else, I got into plants during lockdown. But I have this weird condition where I kill almost every plant that I touch. I have 3 houseplant exceptions, and this is testament only to their pure resilience. I don't know what any of them are called, which might go some way to explaining why all my plants die. I bought one in Lidl. It looks like marujana leaves, but I don't think it is. I keep him in my makeshift office, and when I vacate the room at the weekends, he wilts a bit. I think he likes company. Or maybe I forget to water him when I'm not there. \r\n\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n        <img src=\"../static/img/lockdown2/glenn.jpg\">\r\n        <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n        <img src=\"../static/img/lockdown2/ivy.jpg\">\r\n        <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n      <p>\r\n        'Succulents are very hard to kill,' said the lying bastard of an employee at Dobbie's Garden World, before selling me a string of pearls that would ultimately break my heart and shatter my confidence. Ivy apparently grows like a weed. Pictured: My ivy \r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I summoned my friend Lyndsey to the scene, as she is good with plants. Whenever I go away for a week, she comes by and waters the plants and they are always in much better condition than when I left. She tried her best but eventually even she conceded, it was beyond saving. So I flung it out the window into the dandelion meadow that is our flowerbed. \r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n      <p>\r\n        We got this rock fern. It's a lump of rock with a fern growing on it, and you keep water in the base, as if it's in a river. 'LOW MAINTENANCE' was written on the label. You just keep water in its tray and it'll thrive.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        We kept him for about 2 months after this. He pleaded with us to let him die, but he kept being not 100% dead so we kept watering him.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        I need to stop taking photos of my dead plants. Or at the very least I need to stop framing them.\r\n    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/lockdown2/fern2.jpg\">\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n  \r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n      <p>\r\n        Anyway, then lockdown started and my mum kept sending me gloating pictures of her amazing herb garden and demanding I use the Belfast sink they hauled over on the ferry last year. There weren't many herbs available and coriander is disgusting, so I got mint, chives, basil and parsley.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Obviously basil died as soon as I put it into the planter, but I expected nothing less (Sam's basil FLOWERED. I didn't even know it could do that. I'm pretty surprised since I bought it for her on my weekly shop, which means I had to touch it). \r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        'Careful with that mint,' said everybody I know. 'It'll take over. Even YOU can't kill mint. Haha.'\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        Well how wrong you were, everybody. It's not even the first time <a href=\"http://antheamiddleton.com/post/74\" target=\"_blank\">my parsley has killed my mint</a>. Ian Parsley Jr absolutely tore through the Belfast sink, annihilating everything in his wake. He ate the basil first, then moved onto the chives. The mint, already wilting due to being within a 10m radius of me, put up more of a fight. I'd planted the mint in a pot to stop it taking over. How naive. Ian Parsley Jr even got the mint in the end. Now I have an entire Belfast sink of parsley and the only thing I ever use it for is garlic bread once every month or so. \r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/lockdown2/parsley1.jpg\">\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        It started out ok\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/lockdown2/parsley2.jpg\">\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        What am I going to do.

Fortunately it isn't a neighbourhood window bingo event because I'd definitely feel like I had to participate in that and it would be cold. Corona Bingo is where you tick off all the things you're doing that you thought were unique and creative, but in fact the entire country is baking banana bread and 90% of it is better than yours. \r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I keep making things. On the surface, this sounds ok. But it's become a bit of an addiction and there's only so many shelves someone who has no clutter needs. Does that radiator need a radiator shelf? Do we need a shoe rack? (Actually yes. I stand by the shoe rack). Could my work-from-home desk be extended to also fit my laptop? \r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n        <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n            <img src=\"../static/img/isolation/shoerack_empty.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        I'm going to paint it but you need to save some things to look forward to.\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n        <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n            <img src=\"../static/img/isolation/shoerack_full.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        It's slightly nicer than a pile of shoes.

Just saying.). You too can make a spice rack if you have some wood, an old shower-tidy that you were going to get rid of but then the world shut down, some spare curtain hooks that you refused to throw away because they looked like they might be useful, and assorted paints and varnishes. \r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n        <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n            <img src=\"../static/img/isolation/spice_rack_1.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <p>\r\n      This leftover piece of wood in the shed was plentiful, and just fit my ground cumin, which, by virtue of having a broken seal, gets marginally more use than my Chinese Five Spice.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n        <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n            <img src=\"../static/img/isolation/spice_rack_2.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n              <p>\r\n        This was a terrible shower tidy because it hangs off one hook. Put one bottle of shampoo on and the whole thing tips over. Worse, take one bottle of shampoo OFF and the whole thing tips over. But it was useful for thin metal rods, once I chopped it up. \r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n        <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n            <img src=\"../static/img/isolation/spice_rack_3.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n              <p>\r\n        Measure it up for optimal herb storage.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n        <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n            <img src=\"../static/img/isolation/spice_rack_4.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n              <p>\r\n       Originally I planned to drill holes for the rod barriers, but the piece of wood was only just wide enough to hold Chinese Five Spice, so that wouldn't do. The rods would have to go on the outside. And glueing them would be a travesty.

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n        Flippantly taking our lives in our hands (according to everyone I told I was going to South Africa), we rented a car and drove from Johannesburg airport to Kruger Park. The other drivers were fine, everyone drives on the left (unlike in some countries where side of the driving road seems to be more of a suggestion than a rule), and the roads themselves were grand.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Four hours to Kruger isn't bad, if you haven't just had an overnight connection flight from Saudi Arabia that left at 1.45am. Speaking of which, let's go back for a minute, to talk about Jeddah airport.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Jeddah airport is a strange place. We got in from Athens at about 8pm and the whole place was empty. Apart, apparently, from our flight. But it's not a tiny <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_West_Airport\" target=\"_blank\">Knock-sized</a> airport. It's a massive lavish Dubai-style airport. You walk for absolute miles with the rest of the bemused connection-flight people, seeing maybe 3 cleaning staff the whole time. There are also no planes. It felt like we were in a Derren Brown episode, but luckily it was just a very strange airport.\r\n    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n      <p>\r\n  \r\n        Anyway we made it. Kruger is huge so we stayed in 2 different places. The first was outside, at the Malelane gate, where casual hippos hung out in the river overlooked by the restaurant. Extremely fortunate because as it turned out, these were the only hippos we saw.\r\n\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n        <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n            <img src=\"../static/img/kruger/hippo.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n          All of our pictures are small and far away. It is probably best to Google images of hippos for a better viewing experience.\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n        <p>\r\n            The next two nights, we stayed inside the park in an amazing colonial-themed tented camp place that looked like something straight out of a Poirot. On the way we saw everything from The Lion King, except for lions. Right inside the gate there was a rhino. Sadly, even though it's illegal in Kruger Park, there are massive problems with rhino poachers. We stopped in a town about halfway which had a board for animal sightings and it says don't ever mark rhinos because poachers check.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Elephants can be scary when you're on your own, in a car, in the wild. We stopped to look at a group at the side of the road, and suddenly this huge male one got pissed off and started coming towards us. Dan and I calmly assessed the situation: </p>\r\n            <p>'DRIVE THE FUCKING CAR AWAY FROM THE ELEPHANT, DAN.'</p>\r\n            <p>'It's fine, he's fine.'</p>\r\n            <p>That's essentially how all of our travel arguments go. We are the two terrible extremes when it comes to reactions.</p>\r\n            <p>Anyway eventually he did, but then another elephant comes rumbling across the road in front of us. And he's veering our way. We had to back up, which would mean backing up into the first angry elephant. We were now boxed in by two angry elephants. We backed up the most we thought possible and fortunately he decided he wasn't interested and wandered back off the road instead. When we finally saw lions, they literally lay in the middle of the road, occasionally glancing in our direction and yawning. Lions have nothing on elephants. But The Elephant King would have been a much more cumbersome affair I suppose.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            The tented camp did a 5.30am safari and a 4pm safari. We did both, both days. You know how you can go to Japan and get sick of temples? You can get sick of safaris too. They were 3 hours long, 5.30am is very early, and for the first 2 and a half, all we saw was birds. Worse still, the other people on our safari were absolutely mad for birds. They kept making him stop to look at African pigeons and the like, and all I could think was I got up at 5am to sit here for 15 minutes looking at a pigeon and this is 15 minutes not being spent looking for lions.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            On our last one, we saw lions. I think the only major thing we didn't see was a cheetah.\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n      <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n        <img src=\"../static/img/kruger/camp.jpg\">\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        Look at this place!\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n      <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n        <img src=\"../static/img/kruger/elephants.jpg\">\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        Cute until they try to kill you\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n      <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n        <img src=\"../static/img/kruger/giraffe.jpg\">\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        There's something VERY Lion King about seeing a giraffe ambling about\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n      <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n        <img src=\"../static/img/kruger/rhino.jpg\">\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        Pictured - the back of a rhino, and thumb\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n      <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n        <img src=\"../static/img/kruger/safari.jpg\">\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        Stopping to look at Africa pigeons\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n      <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n        <img src=\"../static/img/kruger/lionesses.jpg\">\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        Apparently they get sick of hanging out with the male lion (who we also saw), because he eats all their food.

Things have moved on, but South Africa is still firmly in the mushroom phase. This is sad if, like me, you hate mushrooms. At the camp, we had no choice in meals except for meat or mushrooms. The meat dishes looked decent in fairness, so I wouldn't say anything against the chef. Luckily by now I had no appetite from taking the malaria tablets, so food was unnecessary.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>One of my favourite brags is that I never get colds. But then I got one. In Africa. This isn't the worst thing that's ever happened to someone, except of course when your cold comes with a cough and everyone around you thinks you have Coronavirus. After Kruger, we drove back to Johannesburg airport where I got to spend a few hours as a pariah. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>At this point, we'd gone for 3 days without Coronavirus news because there's absolute no signal in Kruger. There's a difference between turning your phone off but knowing you have the ability to turn it back on, and having no option to use it whatsoever. Having no signal was an absolute delight. No horrible world news, no messages from well-meaning friends and family asking if I'm going to be trapped in South Africa for the rest of the year, or telling me you can no longer buy any food and people are now living off insects and belts.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Johannesburg Airport was our first Coronavirus shock. Temperature-taking, masks, scary disposal bins for masks with the radioactive symbol on them. At this stage, things were ambiguous. A couple we met at the Turkish Airlines desk told us that Turkish were already stopping connecting flights out of Turkey, but there were no travel advisory warnings. We decided to book a new BA flight home a week early, and gamble on our original flights getting cancelled. We looked it up in the airport and thought yes, that's grand. We can do that when we arrive in Port Elizabeth. Of course everyone else had the same thought, so when we arrived in Port Elizabeth the price had doubled. We booked one two days later. It seemed okay at the time.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

I'd wanted to go to Greece for ages because when I was about 13 I played this game called Quest for Glory V which was set on a fictional ancient Greek island.

It's impressive, but the most interesting bit is how they're restoring it on site while you're wandering around. They meticulously fill in the gaps with white marble.

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThere are lots of reasons people go on holiday. Mine is because we found a business class flight to South Africa for cheaper than economy. I've never flown business class, but most airlines make you walk through business class on your way to your middle-aisle-middle-seat right over the wing. So I know what I've been missing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was with Saudi Air and stops in Jeddah. I was hoping for a long enough stopover that we could leave the airport, because realistically when am I ever going to be in Jeddah? But it's only 6 hours, which is just long enough to be far too long in an airport.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe other caveat was that it only goes from Athens, where we definitely don't live. And to get to Athens on time, we either had to arrive 2 hours before our flight (dodgy, if you're not with the same airline, and Saudi Air don't yet operate a flight from Edinburgh to Athens), or 3 days before our flight. 3 days is a bit much in an airport, but adequate for looking around Athens.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis was all booked in advance for March, then obviously Coronavirus happened. After many arguments about whether or not to cancel the whole thing, Dan won. So we're now in Athens.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the rather odd itinerary:\r\n\r\nAthens for 3 days. Fly via Jeddah to Johannesberg. Drive straight to Kruger Park. Hang around there for a bit. Hopefully see an elephant. Go to Port Elizabeth and drive up the garden route for a few days to Cape Town. Then after 4 days in Cape Town we ended up with this weird thing where we'd have 2 days left, which is too short to go somewhere else in Africa. So we checked to see where we could fly through on our way home (again, this was all pre-Coronavirus). So we stop in Istanbul for 2 nights.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI've been endlessly reassured by everyone I've talked to that I'm definitely going to die on this trip. We'll be carjacked in South Africa, then eaten by a lion, then I'll get Coronavirus. Then, to make it worse, because I probably got the virus in Greece, I'll give it to the lion which is tantamount to poaching. And I'd hate that because I'm a vegetarian.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n      <p>\r\n        Most DIY guides you read on the Internet are, rightfully, written by people who know about DIY and are good at it. So I'm here to fill the niche of <i>DIY Guides from Someone with Enthusiasm and the Ability to Watch a YouTube Video</i>.</p>\r\n        <p>A year and a half ago, Dan and I bought a flat. Years of Grand Designs brainwashing instilled in me a dream. A dream to buy a derelict old wreck of a money pit and transform it into a beautiful quirky home. My dream never featured living in an on-site caravan over 3 brutal winters, getting pregnant 2 months into the renovation and running out of money, so I kind of cherry picked my Grand Designs fantasy.</p>\r\n            <p> Anyway, it didn't work out like that. It turns out, buying a flat in Edinburgh is very hard. The bank won't give you a mortgage for a derelict wreck, and we spent over a year getting harsh rejections (my favourite was blind bidding on a flat in Marchmont. We weren't told the winning bid, only that we were 'the bottom of seven by tens of thousands'). \r\n        \r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n      <p>\r\n        Eventually we bought this flat. It was not a wreck but it did fulfil my deal-breaking criteria of being over a hundred years old. As a non-native, I cannot fathom why anyone would move to Edinburgh – which essentially looks like Hogwarts – and buy a new build. The natives don't agree with me but they also think Irn Bru tastes nice and call all drinkable liquid 'juice' so I don't know. \r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/housediy/house.jpg\">\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        It's the top 2 floors. Interestingly, the door for downstairs is on the other side. A traditional Edinburgh Colony flat.\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n      <p>\r\n        The flat was perfectly fine, but we still did a lot of work on it (that 'we' heavily features my parents, and Dan's family painted the whole place for us). So that very lengthy intro leads me seamlessly onto my first ever house drama DIY blog post. \r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>And it's about sanding. Specifically, sanding the bedroom floor, because the stairs deserves its own blog post.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Before buying this place, I'd never sanded anything. Since buying this place we've sanded the following:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n             Bedroom floor\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n            Back room floor\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n            The stairs\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                    A Welsh dresser I bought for £60 in the British Heart Foundation\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n            The set of existing wooden kitchen cupboards\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                    A table top from an old table, that was placed on top of a lovely Singer Sewing Machine base to make a new table \r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                    Two scaffold planks to make a mantel piece and a dressing table out of\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n            Bedroom floor\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n        <p>\r\n                Sanding is the worst. I hate it. Dan hates it. Everyone hates it. And fuck every YouTube tutorial that has some smug git with one of those light-grit sanding sponges restoring an ancient bedside table ravaged by years of paint and varnish.   \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n                My dad told me to buy a belt sander and I had a sanding head for the multitool already. He also gave me an orbital sander. I now own a lot of sanding equipment. I bought another one of my own volition. That's four electrical sanders. I kept seeing people on home shows using different types of sanders and I thought well I have to try these other sanders. It's not unlike that time I bought three waffle makers, in search for the perfect homemade waffle. Except I, at best, think waffles are okay. I used each one once, and all three are in my parents garage and we occasionally argue about throwing them out. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n                We hadn't even put down the deposit and I was mentally ripping up the pale pink/brown (it's hard to explain how that was the colour, but it was) carpet. Unfortunately, under the carpet was surprise laminate.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n                Side note about the laminate. Ripping up laminate is fine, but not so fine when there's a dividing stud wall halfway across the room on top of it. We had to decide whether or not to knock the wall, or cut around it. We cut around it with the multitool, which took hours and was a truly miserable job. My friend Sam offered to help with the DIY fun so I left her doing that.    \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n                Under the laminate was a perfectly good wooden floor. That'll be easy to sand. We'll just watch a YouTube tutorial and hire a Jewson industrial sander.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n                Don't ever sand a floor yourself. Hire someone to do it. It was about a third of the price to do it ourselves, but it's days of exhausting work. The floorboards are ancient and warped, so you have to take a lot of layers of wood off to even start getting at the grime in the lower hollows. The industrial sanders are a nightmare to manoeuvre and the dust collector exploded twice. At the end we had to go over it all with the belt and orbital sanders to get the in betweeny bits.            \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n                I personally think it was worth it, but of course Dan actually did it and he still wakes up screaming in the night.    \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n                So you can imagine his reaction when I said we were going to rip up the carpet in the back room and sand that floor. And then rip up the carpet on the stairs and sand that. All colour drained from his face and he started shaking and asking what was so wrong with the carpets. A ridiculous question.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n                Those two are done, and I may write about them separately. But the box room awaits.            \r\n        </p>            \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n          <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n            <img src=\"../static/img/housediy/carpet.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n            Hard to capture the brown and the pink, but it was there.\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n          <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n            <img src=\"../static/img/housediy/laminate.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n      SURPRISE!

Like a tropical Australian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick\" target=\"_blank\">North Berwick</a>. The buildings are weatherboarded and the streets are immaculate. They do terrible cheese toasties.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/portdouglas/portdouglas.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAs I've previously mentioned, my parents travelled a lot in Australia when I was a baby. There's a photo on their kitchen wall of me, aged 1, with a tiny ponytail plume (I didn't have much hair and my mum was determined to make the most of it), standing at the window of the Kuranda Scenic Railway train.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Kuranda - a rainforest town - is very close to Cairns and recreating that photo was one of my top priorities for the trip. We were devastated to learn that recent flooding had forced the railway to close for the past few weeks, and delighted to learn that it had just reopened. Honestly, that conversation was a rollercoaster. So we drove to the station, boarded the train, spent about 20 minutes trying to get the photo right, and the rest looking at the rainforest from a comfortable distance.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/portdouglas/kurandathennow.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nYou know how with some people's childhood pictures it's really obviously them because they had distinguishing features? I could not have been a more generic-looking child. If you wanted to show an alien what 'child' looked like, show them this picture. \"Oh it's you as a child! You had a face.\"\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThere were 4 people, student-aged, sitting behind us who spent almost the entire train journey playing Candy Crush on their phones.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/portdouglas/kurandarail.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/portdouglas/kurandaview.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/portdouglas/candycrush.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nKuranda itself is a town that sells sandwiches and tourist tat. Aside from a nice jungle walk that we did, there wasn't a whole lot to see. It's all about the train up there.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>We took the Sky Rail back, a rather terrifying cable car experience, where it shoots you back down the mountain at a great height in a plastic bubble. I have no real fear of heights but I felt rather dizzy going over some of the gorges. </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/portdouglas/kuranda.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nMuch tourist tat to be had.

We had to wait a day for the weather to improve, so on the in between day we went to Daintree Rainforest. Or a close bit of it anyway. The full Daintree experience is a much longer drive and involves a ferry crossing. I didn't even particularly want to go to another rainforest, so we settled for Mossman Gorge. Mossman Gorge is closer. We did rainforest walk, but I've seen so many rainforests at this stage that you could plonk me down in any one of them and ask me where I was and I'd have no idea.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/portdouglas/jungle.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nConsidering my dire swimming skills, we chose a GBR trip where you get a ferry out to a pontoon that's anchored to the sea floor. From here you can have a cup of tea, scuba dive, snorkel and look at an real life underwater aquarium from the lower level. The ferry took an hour and a half and would have tested even the sturdiest sailor's stomach. I might have felt ok if it wasn't for my hugely inconsiderate fellow passengers and their green complexions. It was a long hour and a half.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Bafflingly when we arrived on the pontoon there was a full buffet and everyone from the ferry piled into the queue. Eh, were you not just heaving over the side of the boat ten minutes ago? Dan and I felt a little too shaky to eat, so he persuaded me instead to just try snorkelling.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>I was reluctant, but somehow found myself stuffed into a wetsuit, and a life jacket.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>'First time?' one of the helper lifeguards asked.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>I tried to explain that I was really only considering things at this stage, but he was Australian and they don't believe in faff, so suddenly I had a snorkel affixed to my face and a buoyant pool noodle shoved into my hands.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>'You can't sink,' Dan insisted, 'you're wearing 8 life jackets.' And eventually, still clinging onto the railing of course, I lowered myself into the sea.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Very tentatively, I gave the breathing a go. Then I put my face in and absolutely panicked because the sea bed was very very far beneath me. I took some time to regroup, emptied my snorkel of panic water, and tried again. After a while, it was ok. And after more of a while, I started to enjoy it. After the most of a while, I couldn't believe I'd even considered not trying it.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>The reef is fairly bleached. I've seen photos of its heyday and sadly there's a significant difference. But it's still beautiful and there are so many fish. We went on a snorkel tour with a marine biologist. Unfortunately no sea turtles or sharks. He'd been warned that I'm a terrible swimmer and kept checking if I was ok, which was fine, except when we were swimming back I inhaled some sea water and started coughing.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>'SHE'S CHOKING!' cried out another girl on our tour, frantically trying to get his attention. I tried to wave to indicate that it really was ok, if unpleasant. But waving means panic. So then I tried to do the ok hand symbol but he was already hurtling over.</p>\r\n    <p>'Do you need a lifeguard to bring you back?' he shouted.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>'No, really * cough cough cough *. I really, really don't. I'm fine.'\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>'WE CAN GET A LIFEGUARD.'\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>'Please no.'\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>After a lot of persuasion he conceded. At one point I was worried the helicopter was going to come out for me.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/portdouglas/greatbarrierreef1.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nFish from the acquarium\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/portdouglas/greatbarrierreef2.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nHere's not us getting ready to go in\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOn the trip back to shore, some nice Americans gave us seasickness tablets and told us how much they hated Trump.

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI've been to <a href=\"../post/49\">Adelaide</a> once before. When we lived in Melbourne, Dan and I adopted an Australian attitude to driving and drove 8 hours to visit my cousin Frances and her boyfriend Rob. This time, as we live in Edinburgh, it was easier to fly.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nAforementioned cousin and boyfriend became fiances, so we were going for their wedding. Frances has immense organisational skills. On top of the actual wedding, she had arranged wall to wall activities and barbecues for the guests, as many travelled from pretty far. Note that I am getting married at some point in the future, possibly in a foreign country, and unless you come from the other side of the world I'm not organising activities for you. I've considered asking Frances to organise activities, and possibly my entire wedding, but I might wait for a few days. She has only just finished arranging her own.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nOur first activity was kayaking on Garden Island Boat Ramp. While it was enjoyable and scenic, and I was perfectly happy to sit and talk to the other guests while eating grapes, it did mean a never ending conversation about why I don't want to go kayaking. This is what happens every time a water-based activity comes up in conversation:\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>'IT'S SURF/KAYAKING/SWIMMING/WHITE WATER RAFTING/PEDALO TIME!'\r\n    </br>\r\n    'You guys go on, I'm grand,' I say.</br>\r\n    'Why?'</br>\r\n    'I can't swim.'</br>\r\n    'That is mind blowing and impossible. Explain yourself immediately.'</br>\r\n    'I can kind of swim, but I never learned as a child and I'm not confident in water. I can't tread it and don't like going under the water.'</br>\r\n    A lengthy discussion on each of these topics ensues, ultimately resulting in:</br>\r\n    'You don't have to swim. It's only white water rafting in extreme rapids and there's only two waterfalls and the water isn't that deep.'\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>I used to feel hard done by by this conversation until I reacted the exact same way to someone who couldn't ride a bike and they told me not being able to swim is stupider than not being able to ride a bike. They were right. You're downright unlikely to drown because you can't ride a bike.</p>\r\n    <p>So I ate crisps on the grass while everyone else saw a dolphin.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      In between the 47 barbecues, there was the hen party. Frances opted for what she called an 'energetic' early morning walk up Mount Lofty (this is, of course, the same cousin who had barely gotten off the plane in Edinburgh before spotting Arthur's Seat), followed by afternoon tea.</p>\r\n      <p>\r\n      I turned to my fellow hens, ready to bond over how awful a jetlagged early morning mountain hike sounded, only to realise they were all dancers, gymnasts and personal trainers. I hope to never again be in a situation where I'm the only person who doesn't want to do a jetlagged early-morning mountain hike. It wasn't mandatory, but I signed up anyway as I didn't want to be that person. Then I big fat didn't do it. I loudly told anyone who'd listen about my dreadful jetlag at the afternoon tea, constantly excusing my absence at the hike. I think people cared less about my absence than they did about this moany dose who wouldn't shut up about her jetlag.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/adelaideII/hens.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nNot shown: My slightly green palour due to jetlag and guilt at not doing the walk\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe wedding itself was a delight and involved no hiking or kayaking. Someone arranged an after party, which inexplicably was a half hour taxi journey away. Unfortunate, as everyone was staying about 2 minutes from the wedding venue. We complained a lot but got over it eventually.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nThe following day, we had one more barbecue before we left for Alice Springs. My bridesmaid duties now over, I wasn't required until late afternoon so I finally had a chance to look around Semaphore. I'm told we saw Semaphore the last time but have no memory of it. Our hotel fronted a white sand beach with clear water and a lovely pier. Even better, there were lots of cute dogs being walked and I got to watch them every morning at breakfast.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/adelaideII/pier.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe pier is so nice that it's actually possible to get a photo of it\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/adelaideII/hotel.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nOur hotel's lovely balcony, looking at pier (see left)\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nSince we were only spending 2-3 days in each place, and had planned to visit 7 places over our three-week period, we thought we'd end our trip with a nice relaxing beach-front hotel in Drake Bay. Two hours from Manuel Antonio is a town called Sierpe, that no one in our trendy hostel had heard of. We'd planned to get a bus, but left it too late and all the seats were booked. We tried to plan another bus, but all the seats on all the busses in Costa Rica were booked. We tried everything, but in the end had to take the hostel's shuttle that they'd been pushing on us since we arrived. They did knock down the price, and the driver had a sat nav, so it wasn't too bad.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe arrived in Sierpe in blistering heat and waited 2 hours for the boat to Drake Bay. When the boat was suitably packed with the population of Sierpe, we set off peacefully down a river, then rather unpeacefully into the sea. The closer we got to Drake Bay, the more clouds covered the sky and the rockier the boat became. We arrived after an hour, drenched, but happy to not be on a boat anymore.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/drakebay/sierpe.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nIt started off well\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n'Shoes off!' the boat guys said, gesturing to the knee-level water we now had to wade through to get onto the beach. We followed the nice lady from our hotel up the beach and onto the road, where we walked barefoot for about five minutes until we got to the hotel. By now there was no sun and a smattering of rain. The hotel itself was lovely, the room being by far the nicest we've had since we arrived in Colombia. And our balcony had a hammock, which was good news because on our way I'd said to Dan that if there was no hammock I was going to throw an absolute hissy fit.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIt was already late afternoon when we arrived, so all we did was talk to one of the staff about all the exciting extreme tours we could go on for the next two days. I was still feeling faintly ill from the boat and the Costa Rican tap water, so I must have gone a delightful shade of green when she started talking about ziplining. We settled on a national park tour with the other 3 hotel guests because, you know, we hadn't seen enough national parks yet. But it seemed the least extreme thing on offer. Also they wouldn't have run it without us.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe national park tour naturally started at 6am. They encouraged us to get up at 5am so we could eat a big breakfast, preparing us for the day ahead. When we were suitably full of breakfast, our guide arrived and told us that although the weather wasn't great, we should be ok to get the 40 minute boat to the national park. There were several things wrong here. Firstly, I had vowed to everyone in the hotel that after the previous day's boat adventure, I'd never be getting another boat. Secondly, we had just eaten a monstrous breakfast. Thirdly, the weather wasn't \"not great\". Overnight, some sort of small typhoon had blustered into the bay.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nSince we'd already paid, we sadly waded back out to the boat and spent a torturous 40 minutes gripping the edge and staring intently at the horizon. At some points the boat was almost vertical. When we arrived, a river had formed blocking the way into the jungle. No worries, it's only thigh-high right now so we can wade through. After about twenty minutes of walking, our guide admitted that the tour would be better if the rain wasn't so heavy. At this point we were walking through a newly formed lake, unable to see our hands in front of our faces. Did you know you can get cold in Costa Rica? I know you can get cold in Costa Rica. So we headed back. The river was now about waist-high. We hung around the park ranger's shelter for a bit, the guide saying we could wait and see if it clears up then try again. But the other couple said no, let's go now. I said, could we not just wait half an hour? The guide said no, they want to go. So off they went, leaving me, Dan and one other lady alone on the beach for two hours. Of course about half an hour after they left, the weather started to pick up. But we couldn't do anything because we now had no guide.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/drakebay/river.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nI wasn't prepared for this level of wading\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/drakebay/beach.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nWe got to know this stretch of beach very well\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/drakebay/doll.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nHello to you too, creepy washed-up doll hand\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>By this point, Dan was very sad. In fact, I thought, he was too sad. His sadness, on top of everything else about the terrible day, was annoying me.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>'What is wrong with you?' I demanded.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>'Nothing. Just not a great day that's all.' He climbed onto a rock and stared morosely out at the horizon.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>This was very out of character. I think we could both agree that the day had been fairly crap, but surely not staring-morosely-out-to-sea crap. It was only one day of a 3-week holiday after all. Following a tense argument, I stormed off and hung out with Gina instead, the other lady on the tour, until the others got back.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWhen they returned, our guide announced it was time for an hour-long lunch. By this stage, tempers were high among those of us left on the beach for two hours. He said we should be able to do a bit of a walk on the other side before heading back. Okay great, let's go then. No, first we eat. For one hour. 50 minutes into this needlessly elaborate meal, the rain started again. I watched with barely-contained simmering rage as our guide slowly finished his bag of crisps, then began slowly packing everything back up. By the time we got back into the jungle the rain was no longer drizzle, but luckily not yet the torrent it had been before.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nFluffy Costa Rican animals don't like rain any more than tourists do, so all we saw was a few insects and one confused howler monkey about one mile upwards shrouded by leaves. We persevered for an hour, everyone glancing nervously towards the sea as the winds picked up more and more.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/drakebay/husk.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nHighlight of national park tour: Shedded insect shell\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>By the time we got back to the ranger's shelter, I assumed he was going to say it wasn't safe to sail back to the hotel.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Nope, it was safe. Everybody on.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Bizarrely, though it was far choppier than the route over, because we were travelling with the waves no one felt seasick. We did, however, think we might die.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>We arrived back soaked to the bone, had a lukewarm shower (there was no temperature setting) and had the most wonderful cup of tea I could ever remember.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Then the storm really kicked up and the power went out. Over a necessarily candle-lit dinner, we learned that the national park was a popular drop-off point for cocaine smugglers and the rangers face almost-certain death if they see anything.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>The next day, the storm passed. The power decided it wasn't really ready to face the world yet. A new family had arrived and were voicing concerns about their flight back the next day. Like us, they were planning to get a tiny plane from Drake Bay to San Jose, then travel on from there.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>'What's the issue?' we asked, as they were questioning a man working in the hotel.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The road into Drake Bay was now blocked by a sizeable river.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>'What about another road?'\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The hotel guy stared back at me. 'The road is blocked by the river.'\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Was there a way across the only road into Drake Bay?\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>'You could wade. It is now about chest-high.'\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>'We have two rucksacks.'\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He shrugged.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Dan and I thought about it. The alternative to wading through the river would be getting the boat back to Sierpe, then a 6-hour bus to San Jose airport. We told him we'd just go for it. Surely we'd be able to shower somewhere before the flight home.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>'Great!' he said. 'Except you should know that your plane may not take off.'\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Given the frequency of the storms, there was a high chance we'd wade through the river, then have to wade back, and be too late to get the boat and bus to San Jose.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In the end we decided on the boat and bus. Most annoyingly, the plane did take off, so we couldn't even get a refund.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThat stressful interlude over, Dan and I went for a walk on the beautiful beach, in the now beautiful weather, and I found out why he'd been so sad. He asked me to marry him, and had waited 3 weeks carrying the ring all over Colombia, imagining Drake Bay would be the most idyllic setting. When it turned out to be quite possibly the worst part of our whole trip, he'd wished he'd picked any number of other places along the way. He did say that he'd decided if it wasn't going to be romantic, he'd wanted it to be funny, and had wished he'd brought the ring along so he could have proposed on the roller-coaster storm boat the day before.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/drakebay/ring.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nI sent this picture to friends and family with the caption \"News\". Apparently most of them just thought I was sending them a picture of me and Dan on a beach and thought \"er... That's nice?\"\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe began the boat-bus trek back the next day and were most distressed to arrive in San Jose airport that evening and find our flight had been cancelled. Next flight out was the following afternoon. They put us up in bland-but-pleasant hotel and I've never seen so many grumpy people sitting around a pool.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nSan Jose to Paris, stopover for a few hours, then Paris to Edinburgh, meant when we got home we hadn't slept for about 36 hours. It was evening, so looked like it was going to be ideal. Get home, have a shower, buy a frozen pizza, go to bed.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nExcept our flat had been broken into.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThey stole my <a href=\"../post/77\">laptop</a>. I can only hope that whoever bought it off Gumtree reads my blog and notices the screw drilled into the case. So far, no success on that front.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI will say, the stress of dealing with a break-in after a long distance flight and no sleep is a good way of mitigating jetlag.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWhen we <a href=\"../post/38\">lived in Australia</a>, we never saw the outback. This was due to a series of circumstances but the dominating factor was that we had a car in Melbourne and didn't want to rent a second one in the Northern Territory. If we'd stayed longer we would have made it up North. Not getting there was one of my biggest Australian regrets, especially as my parents were much more intrepid adventurers than I, and their fondest memories are outback trekking disasters. They were probably thinking 'how did we raise such a daughter, who is content to stay in her air conditioned flat in Melbourne?'\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/outback_parents.png\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n      My parents, having much more hardy adventures than I\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/outback_parents2.png\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n      You can read the full story about them dragging this Holden Kingswood through a river on my <a href=\"http://arthurmiddleton.ie/home-built-trailer\" target=\"_blank\">dad's website</a>, because you won't find any such heroics on this one.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWell not anymore.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nAlthough I will say, our outback adventure had an air conditioned 4x4, no accompanying baby, lasted 5 days and not a tent in sight. Well, there were tents in sight, because all of the hostels/motels had a campground. But I made sure to stay well away, in case I caught any sense of 'roughing it'.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nWe flew from Adelaide to Alice Springs, rented a Nissan X Trail and found out that it only covered 400km and every km after that cost 25c. That was a fairly big hit to take, but we had no choice.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nThere are a few ways to get to Uluru. There's an airport, so you could just fly there. Boring. You can fly to Alice Springs and drive the “quick” way – 6 hours on a paved road. You can fly to Alice Springs and drive the Red Centre Way (part of which is the Mereenie Loop). We chose the latter, and made three overnight stops en route.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nInternet advised you to bring lots of food, as there aren't many shops on the Red Centre Way. Taking this advice to heart, we bought every non-perishable item in Alice Spring's Coles. 4 days is a lot, we thought. Better buy 300 bags of trail mix. We also bought insect attractant, masquerading as repellent. The airport, supermarket, and hotel on our way back was all we saw of Alice Springs. It's rather a neglected place, full of poverty and run-down buildings. The scenery is nice, as they have quite a lot of green in amongst the orange roads, but it could certainly use a spruce. I figured they'd get quite a bit of tourism but perhaps people only use the airport, or stay one night like us.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <h3>Mount Zeal</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\nOn our way to our first stop, Glen Helen Homestead at Mount Zeal (the only overnight option, but a perfectly nice one), we visited 3 sites. The first was Simpson's Gap, which was beautiful if you could see through the swarms of flies intent on resting on your eyes. The second was the Ellery Creek Big Hole. It looked much like Simpsons Gap but with less flies, so an improvement. I'm not sure why it was called the Big Hole. I suppose a medium-sized lake is a hole.

There was wifi in the lobby, which was a surprise as there was barely wifi in Melbourne when we lived there. It was fine, but what really made it was stepping out of our door.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/glenhelen.JPG\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n      Good porch views\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/glenhelen2.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n      Dan swam in the nearby trecherous lake.

I convinced Dan to get excess insurance on the car, which was good because when we finished the dirt bit it certainly had more rattles than before, and several gravel-induced windscreen marks.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nDriving on the dirt road was awfully fun. We drove painfully slowly at first, but after the 5th 4x4 barrelled past us in the opposite direction, quite literally leaving us in their dust, we got braver with speed. It still took quite a bit longer than a paved road, though shorter than my pessimistic Google Map estimated (4 hours, versus 7). The only stop we made on this part was the Gosse Bluff meteor crater. This was actually before the dirt road started, though the road from the main road to Gosse Bluff was the rockiest part. One great thing about all this central Australian area is that much of it is aboriginal protected land, meaning you're not allowed to climb hills. No excuses necessary, this meteor site is sacred. You can drive into the middle and have a look around, but then you have to get right back in your car again and get going. My sort of outback adventure.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/dirtroad.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/wash.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\"Just when you need to get a wash on, nature delivers.\" - Dan\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/crater.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nYou're humouring me if you tell me these pictures are amazing.

King's Canyon Resort had a range of accommodation starting at tent, ending at fancy motel room. Ours was obviously not a tent. I'm not sure where on the range it sat, but it was nice and had an outdoor pavement area where you could sit at night and look at the very bright milky way. Only in <a href=\"../post/45\">New Zealand</a> had I ever seen such a dazzling night sky.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/zeal.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n      We did a walking trail near the motel and got hopelessly lost and Dan started telling me this story about two guys who got lost forever in the desert in New Mexico and ate their own arms or something.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nSince turning into a vegetarian a few months ago, I've never found it tougher than I did in Australia. Australians like meat. Everything has meat. Their burger buns are made of meat. Their salads are made of meat. There's usually one vegetarian option and it was always mushroom, which I also don't like. But King's Canyon offered a barbecue where you could choose stuff, they'd barbecue it, and give you a baked potato and salad. Up until now, I'd mostly survived on potato and salad, but here they had a mushroom-free veggie burger. So King's Canyon barbecue wins.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>We tried to watch the sunset but it was covered in clouds. That was fine with me. Sunsets are overrated. I remember being at the Grand Canyon for sunset. I remember thinking how cold it gets, and how I was hungry, and how bloody long the sun was taking to set, and how we still had a 5-hour bus journey back to Vegas with a fellow passenger who was carsick the whole way up. I do not remember the actual sunset. I'm assured it was nice and I'm a philistine.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <h3>Yulara/Uluru</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\nOur final destination was a mere 3.5 hour drive on a paved road, which was starting to seem short. At this stage our formerly white X Trail was red, as were all of our clothes, our trail mix and even things buried in the deepest centre of many bags. This bit had lots of toilets. I think they could do with spreading the toilets a bit better.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nWe arrived at 3, in absolutely baking heat. It would have been impossible to see Uluru that day, as we would have caught fire, so we looked around Yulara - the local tourist town. Yet again, you have no choices in Yulara. It looks like there's a fancy hotel, a motel, a hostel and a campsite, but they're all owned by the same group. The illusion of choice. The campsite is cheap, the hotel is extremely expensive, and the other two are only very expensive. Everything in Yulara is expensive because you are hours from anywhere else, so what are you going to do?\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/yulara.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nYulara Town Centre\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/ulurudistance.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nUluru from a distance\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nDan made me get up at 6 to watch the sunrise. I'd never seen a sunrise. When we stayed in <a href=\"../post/67\">Lake Atitlan in Guatemala</a>, you could watch the sunrise from our bedroom window and I still didn't bother getting up for it. Dan did. He said it was nice.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nThis time, for some reason, I relented. We traipsed off to a viewing platform and watched the sunrise. Good thing we did, as we didn't realise that you're supposed to be back from any Uluru trekking by 11am.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/sunrise.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nMeh.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIt was nice to see Uluru, though technically I had seen it once before, aged about 1 (I was aged 1, not Uluru you understand). I didn't remember it very well, so was worth going again. It's bigger than I thought. You are asked not to climb it as it is a sacred aboriginal site. Lots of people climbed it anyway while we were there. Rude, I think. Why unnecessarily upset people? Your ancestors already upset them enough. Just don't climb the rock, how difficult is that? There's also another rock nearby which you can climb. Such entitlement. Take away the safety handrail, I say.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>We were too late to do the perimeter walk, because you have to be back by 11, so we did a shorter one around part of the base and back. This was a huge relief as it was about 36 degrees already. You can still see some caves and drawings, if you can fight your way through the flies.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Note on the flies: I realised that a leafy branch makes an effective and simple fly-swat and keeps them away from your face. At some point I saw a sign that said 'All of this land is protected aboriginal land, please do not break branches to use as fly swats'. So maybe I have no right to rant about climbing Uluru. I did break the branch back at our motel, which didn't seem THAT sacred.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/uluru1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThere they are climbing it for no good reason.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/uluru2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nCave drawings\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/redcentre/uluru3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nIt's very orange\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nUluru complete, we drove back to Alice Springs the “quick” way and ate in a mediocre pizza place.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe flew from Arenal to Drake bay, via San Jose, in a Cessna Caravan. These are tiny little planes with 10 seats, no tea trolley, and about 3 jokes about the tea trolley per flight. We sat right up the front and could watch the course and weather maps over the pilots' shoulders. The airport was smaller than my flat, and check-in gave us a plastic boarding card, which we had to give back on the steps to the plane. I loved it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/manuelantonio/airport.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nA relaxing airport experience\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/manuelantonio/runway.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nAn initially concerning aeroplane experience.

They stood on the other side of the fence where the plane landed and tried to get us to come through a small opening. But then someone unloaded the bags and brought them all to the main gate, a few meters up. It soon became obvious why, as we had to pay a $7 'exit tax'. Money resentfully parted with, we hopped into the taxi. Immediately we were accosted with a speech on how much extreme, but laid back, fun the hostel was. 'We had a Halloween party last night,' he said. I'd completely forgotten it was Halloween. 'Didn't wind down until 3am! That's how we roll here in the Fun Hostel. So laid back, you won't believe it. Fun, and being laid back. That's what we're about. You guys are gonna love it.' So far all I loved was that the massive party had happened the night before we arrived. I think he misunderstood my enthusiasm.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nChecking in, we were told about the many extreme activities we could do in Manuel Antonio. I wasn't surprised to see several references to ziplining and rafting. The hostel was mostly made up of steps, ensuring you had to go up and down at least four flights of stairs to get from any one point to another. But it was clean and pleasant, and had a good pool. It also had cute large wild rodent that roamed the paths, presumably looking for some laid back fun. I couldn't get close enough for a good picture.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nJust opposite was a restaurant, the centrepiece of which was a C123 cargo plane (<a href=\"https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/why-plane-became-restaurant-and-bar-tales-revolution-cia-plots-arms-trading-central-america\" target=\"_blank\">shot down over Nicaragua in 1986</a>), converted into the restaurant bar. I firmly believe this was Dan's favourite part of Costa Rica. There was also a rather fantastic view of the sunset. We weren't in a town, so our dining options were limited to the aeroplane place, the pizzeria next door, and the cafe where we were staying. I was a little alarmed at the lack of towns in our Costa Rica destinations. I'm not used to things being slightly inconvenient.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/manuelantonio/planebar.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThis trip contained a surprising amount of interesting aeroplane bits\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/manuelantonio/planebarinterior.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe interior, including a cockpit you could climb into.

En route we were approached by many locals, telling us that without paying them money, we had no hope of seeing any wildlife. Trip Advisor had told us that you can't move for the wildlife, and there is absolutely no need to pay a guide. Trip Advisor was correct. If anything, we could have done with less wildlife.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe national park was tourist-friendly, with wide paved paths and glum-looking Americans who'd been duped into paying a \"tour guide\". In saying that, we did pass one such group as their guide was showing them a sloth through a telescope and they let us have a look, even though we hadn't paid.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI had really wanted to see a sloth. In our whole time in Costa Rica we saw three, but they were all so high up and obscured by leaves that it wasn't quite as spectacular as I'd imagined. We did see a lot of monkeys that looked like Marcel from Friends. But my absolute favourite was real life raccoons. The Americans were understandably baffled at our amazement as we constantly clapped our hands together and gushed about how cute the furry little burglars were, with their furry little burglar hands. I believe in America they view them as we view pigeons. There were also howler monkeys. Not as fearless as the capuchin, we only saw them in trees, rather than on the beach stealing people's suncream. They're cute and noisy.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/manuelantonio/beach.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nLook at this beach.

I refused to eat, so Dan went across the road and brought back a takeaway pizza. In the time it took, I opened up more to the idea of eating three pizza slices and, much to Dan's dismay, joined him in the hostel bar. Our super-laid-back hostel was unhappy that we'd brought our own food in and we received a stern warning.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>The pizza was good.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

Our first Costa Rica stop was Arenal, an area of tropical national parks surrounding a volcano. Getting there from Cartagena was standard. Deathly early flight to Bogota, stopover, flight to San Jose, 6-hour wait in a giant all-American Dennys by the airport, then a 4-hour bus to Arenal. Easy.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe stayed on the outskirts of nearby town La Fortuna. As we found out when booking, everything in Costa Rica is extremely expensive. So gone were our nice cheap hotels of Colombia. It was now time for a more basic (though still far more expensive), hostel alternative. Most of the countryside accommodation in La Fortuna comes in the form of cabins, or lodges. Ours was clean and had hot water, but the wifi was devastatingly bad. On our last day we had a couple of hours in the morning before leaving for the airport and I almost used my laptop to smash up their modem when trying to upload my Medellin blog post.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>The weather was a little unhinged, but we did get some nice clear skies where you could see the volcano from our cabin.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/arenal/volcano.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nMe and volcano\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nCosta Rica is really into activities. You can't walk a mile without having someone zipline over you. White water rafting, waterfall hiking, kayaking, extreme kayaking, extreme zipline into kayak for white water rafting. It reminded me of Queenstown, NZ, where if you weren't careful you'd accidentally find yourself in a bungee jump queue when you were just trying to buy crisps in the supermarket.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI used to feel slightly guilty about not wanting to do extreme zipline rafting, or whatever. But now I've reached an inner peace where I don't care in the slightest. Also, I can't swim. But if you don't want to do stuff that requires a helmet, Costa Rica is basically one big national park divided into smaller national parks. So you can look at them instead.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOn our first day, we visited the Hanging Bridges - staggeringly tall suspension bridges joining up paths of a jungle hike. It took about 2 hours to do the walk. You do get some spectacular views from the bridges but unless you are a completely insane adrenaline junkie, you're mostly thinking 'dear God get me off this bridge'. Since it only took 2 hours, we had to go find another activity. Cue our second two-hour hike, this time up to the volcano basin to see all the volcanic rock and a decent view of the surrounding area. We did not climb the volcano.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/arenal/bridge.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nNot shown: Vertigo-inducing height\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/arenal/rock.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nNot shown: Decent picture of volcanic rock.

Many resorts are centred around them and for a hefty wad of cash, you can visit. So we spent our evening hopping from spring to spring in a resort where renting a towel cost more than 3 nights in our cabin. They had done an amazing job of converting the springs. Some were quite natural streams and little waterfalls, still with the stones and sand at the base. But for the less hardened traveller (perhaps one who does not own a fine pair of combats), they also had paved pools. As it grew dark, they lit up the springs with pretty lights. It was a delight. And unlike in <a href=\"../post/43\">New Zealand</a>, there was no overwhelming smell of sulphur, meaning we didn't ruin every item of clothing we brought with us.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/arenal/spring.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe following day, we undertook yet another jungle hike. This time, to see a magnificent waterfall. We tried to walk but two huge barking dogs were chasing people going past their driveway. A taxi is a small price to pay to not get rabies. Once there, It's easy getting to the waterfall. 500 steps down. But then you have to get back up. Luckily they had motivational signs for the climb back, giving us sage advice from Guru Sloth.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n        <img src=\"../static/img/arenal/waterfall1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/arenal/waterfall2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/arenal/waterfall3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/arenal/waterfall4.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n      As always, Dan swam and I took photos. Even if I could swim, I'm not sure I would have. Because the waterfall is so tall, it fairly smashes the water at the base. You can't swim too close because the currents are so strong that you might get sucked in and not be able to get back out. Also it was bloody freezing.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Beautiful though.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWith not much time left on our last day, we had a look around La Fortuna. There's not a lot to see. It serves as a base for all the extreme activities and has some shops, hostels and restaurants.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/arenal/town.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOne thing about Costa Rica is that mostly the water is safe to drink.

Furthermore, if the water is considered safe, it will be used for everything so is completely unavoidable. So on our first Arenal morning, I woke up with a pain in my stomach. It eased off a bit.

I highly recommend this route, and not the reverse, as that would be a rather grim way to end your holiday. Although Medellin and Bogota do have safe drinking water. Ever try have a shower and not get your face wet? It's no mean feat.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nCartagena, like Santa Marta, is on the sea. You can stay in a resort hotel on the sea front, or you can stay near/in the walled city. There may be other tourist areas, but we only had 1.5 days so that's the extent of our knowledge. We stayed a few minutes from the walled city and didn't have time to see the coastal bit. But figured we saw a good beach in Santa Marta anyway.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nBuoyed by the success of our free walking tour in Bogota, we signed up for another one in the walled city. This one was shorter, less fluent and far more rehearsed, but he did give out postcards for answers to impromptu quizzes. Postcards and post in general is like golddust in Colombia so we fought the other tourists tooth and nail to win one. They, oddly, didn't seem fussed. It wasn't even a real postcard, just an ad for the tour with tour info where you're meant to put the address. I tried to send it to my friend Keeva so I'll be interested to see how liberal the postal service are.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nCartagena's walled city reminded me a lot of <a href=\"../post/7\">Havana</a>, with its turrets, barricades and old Spanish-colonial architecture. It was more pristine than Santa Marta, but because of this, I found it a little less genuine. There were no kids practicing break dancing routines on the square, for instance. There were instead, 40 taxi hawkers.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/cartagena/centre1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/cartagena/battlements.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/cartagena/street.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/cartagena/square.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe ate the worst meal of our trip in a small Italian restaurant. We were the only customers, and it soon became apparent why. I ordered the Anthea-travelling-classic: pasta with tomato sauce. It seemed someone had sent back what the chef considered to be a perfectly good carbonara, so he had heated it up and dumped some tomato sauce on top. I asked in our restaurant the second night if this was a Colombian thing and the waiter was utterly horrified. Dan received a meat salad. A pile of different types of chopped up meat on a plate. Even for the most carnivorous palate it would be nauseating. I can't remember the name of the restaurant, or where it was. But don't go there.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOn our second and last day, we went to the San Felipe de Barajas Castle. I do always love a castle. There wasn't much of a hike, or many steps, which is unusual for anything in Colombia, and we had a nice view of the city. Sub-standard ice pops though if we're honest. We spent many hours trying to buy stamps for the rare and elusive postcards we'd managed to pick up. When we finally got the stamps (in a sort of art gallery/keyring shop, of course), a local reminded us it was Saturday so the (one) post office was closed. We asked them in our hotel to post them. We will see.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/cartagena/battlements.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <h3>Colombia Conclusions</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\nIt certainly doesn't deserve its reputation. At no point were we even close to getting kidnapped by FARC guerrillas. If you are sensible (don't go past street 13, don't shuffle wads of cash in public, don't get dodgy looking public transport) you'll almost certainly have no issues. There are truly beautiful places outside the cities, filled with tropical rainforest, lakes and colourful colonial buildings. And Santa Marta and Cartagena are beautiful in and of themselves. Don't skip Bogota, but don't spend more than a day. It's interesting, and good to see the less pristine parts.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Stuff is incredibly cheap. Food, accommodation, tours. It seems bewildering because they put 20 or so 0s at the end of their currency, but you're usually only paying a few dollars for virtually everything. The people in general are hugely friendly and helpful, and will do everything they can to understand your awful Spanish.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Like <a href=\"../post/68\">Guatemala</a>, don't be put off by the odd hysterical eejit on Trip Advisor who heeded none of the advice and got robbed while comparing Rolex watches in loud slow English on a rural chicken bus.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

We had booked a handy 11am Avianca flight from Medellin to Santa Marta, so we'd arrive at 12. Avianca had other ideas, and booted us off our nice flight and put us on a 7am to Bogota where we could wait for a bit, until a 10am to Santa Marta. Not so convenient.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Santa Marta is quite small, and the nice, touristy bit is tiny. We were warned don't go beyond street 13 (the streets are numbered in a grid). What happens past street 13? Just don't go there. Okay.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Exhausted and hungry from our hundred flights that morning, we were delighted to find a sandwich shop. I had scared myself senseless reading about the tap water in Santa Marta so was faced with a massive dilemma when they put ice in my drink. On the one hand, I didn't want to be impolite and imply they would use tap water in such a lovely establishment. On the other hand, I didn't want to die from tap water consumption. But my Irish politeness won out and I drank the damn thing. As of writing, I am still reasonably intact.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I love Santa Marta. It's by the sea and though the water near the centre isn't safe, it still has a beautiful boardwalk. The centre is lit by fairy lights and colourful bars, restaurants and shops. Local kids practice break dancing routines in the square. They were more skilled than any acts I saw at the Fringe and they weren't even taking money. There are a lot of hawkers, and if you're eating outside, some awful singer with a mic and a backing track will rock up and start screeching then ask for money. But it's a small price to pay (especially small if you don't actually pay him).\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/santamarta/night.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/santamarta/street.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nFor the first time since we'd arrived in Colombia, we didn't get any form of public transport (that is of course if you discount the two flights we took to get to Santa Marta) and just wandered around for the day then sat by the pool. It was nice.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nEnough of that though, the next day was jungle trek time. Tayrona National Park is about an hour from Santa Marta. We had planned to get a taxi to the bus station (you can't walk as you'll go past the dreaded street 13) but our taxi driver was very persuasive and eventually convinced us to let him bring us the whole way. It cost about $25 and he dropped us to the gate. We were also swayed because it was much quicker than the bus and we'd faffed around too long that morning.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe bought our tickets and 5 minutes into the jungle walk were completely bathed in sweat. It was about 34 degrees, but not so bad in the shade. Along the way were two campsites, for completely insane people, but they did have toilets. There were also a few pretty beaches that we didn't have time to see properly because of aforementioned faffing (you have to leave before dark because the jungle doesn't have many street lights). It took three hours including our stops to make it to the final beach. Set in a sort of cove, El Cabo beach has that emerald colour that you assume has been photoshopped. On a hill looking over the sea there are hammocks where the most hardy of adventurer can stay overnight. Those are the sort of adventurers who wear khaki jackets with combats, and the type I hope never to be associated with. You're basically under a big umbrella sharing the space with 30 strangers, in hammocks. No thanks.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/santamarta/tayrona1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/santamarta/tayrona2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nTreacherous river-crossing.

The pharmacist I went to said that Colombia is no longer a malaria zone, but under no circumstance get bitten by mosquitoes, and sold me mosquito-repellent. I think he accidentally sold me essence of human blood because after the walk back (which mysteriously only took 2 hours), Dan and I were absolutely covered in mosquito bites. We're now anxiously waiting for the dengue fever to set in.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

So now we've both embarrassingly learned that after pronouncing it wrong to several locals, let's continue.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nEdinburgh should have prepared me for all the bloody hills in Colombia. But then I remembered I drive everywhere, so that won't work. Medellin is in a valley, and up the sides of the valley. We got a taxi from the airport that took about 45 minutes, just enough time to convince yourself you're being driven into the mountains to be held to ransom. Very unfair on our perfectly pleasant taxi driver, who of course just dropped us off at our hotel. We only had a day and a half in Medellin, something that is somewhat of a theme on this trip. So on our day of arrival we ate a Subway and took some trams to Acevedo. It became increasingly obvious that El Poblado, the area we stayed in, was by far the wealthiest area of the city. Our plan was to get a cable car from Acevedo to Park Arvi, at the top of one of the surrounding mountains, but when we got to the top, it was closed. This was probably something the woman who sold us the round-trip ticket could have told us, but we decided not to dwell.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe cable car in itself is a worthwhile experience. It brings you up the mountainside over stacks and stacks of favelas, showing you undeniably that there is a lot more to Medellin than El Poblado. With the park closed, we got out at the Santa Domingo stop on the top of the mountain, formerly called Pablo Escobar. During his hey-day it was one of the most dangerous areas of Medellin, built by Escobar as a lookout spot. Now it's somewhat of a tourist destination. More colourful and in a generally better state than most of the neighbourhoods leading up to it, it's a lively, charming place. We bought some ice creams.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/medellin/cablecar1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nColombia is great if, like me, you enjoy a cable car\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/medellin/cablecar2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe view from the cable car on the way up.

This will be a good place to get a postcard, I thought naively. 400 stalls later, I gave up. There was not a single postcard to be found in Medellin. But while there were no postcards, there were some large Botero statues. They really like Botero in Colombia.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/medellin/horse.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThis is a Botero horse.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/medellin/market.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nNot a postcard to be seen\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe ate in El Poblado. Eating in Colombia hadn't been particularly tricky so far. Aside from the local cafes (not brave enough for that yet) there's more pizzerias than there is Latin American food. We found somewhere that served pasta in tomato sauce and ate there twice. I ordered the same thing, twice. The waitress was very impressed with my Spanish when I managed to say 'sin pollo' (without chicken - I tend to eat vegetarian when travelling). I did try to learn some Spanish before we left, using the language app Duolingo. The problem with Duolingo is that it really pushes you to get streaks (when you do an exercise every day) but once you break your streak you lose all motivation. They need to work on their gamification.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe following day we got a bus to Guatape, a town about 2 hours outside Medellin. Tourists pay for their seats in the station but the driver will pick up any locals he wants along the way. It was drama-free until a group of 6 police stopped the bus about an hour in. A sniffer dog got on and started barking at a man with a teardrop tattoo on his face. He was taken off, frisked, his switch blade taken off him, then let back on. I guess I was just glad he no longer had his switchblade.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAs we neared Guatape, the scenery got more and more beautiful. Multiple lakes broke up the jungley mountains. We got out at El Penol, a big hill with 740 steps to the top. Note, these steps do not include the hill up to the steps. I was not happy. But I wheezed my way up nonetheless (I didn't see Dan do any wheezing), pausing to let women with babies and 80-year-olds pass me by. When we reached the top I collapsed into a chair. Dan didn't even sit down, until I got so irritated that I demanded he at least pretend the climb was tough.

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nBogota introduced me to a new, unfamiliar friend: altitude sickness. Bogota is 2640m above sea level, which means the air is thinner and you feel like you have a permanent hangover. However the feeling is probably not dissimilar to how one might feel after having 3 hours sleep in the previous 2 days so maybe I didn't have altitude sickness at all, and was in fact, tired. Altitude sickness sounded better and like it would garner more sympathy though, so let's assume it was that.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      Apart from its silly setting far above sea level, Bogota is an interesting place. We were warned by the hotel staff not to walk around after dark, hail random taxis or have our phones out, but we never felt particularly unsafe.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bogota/streetcorner.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nStreet corner outside our hotel. Perhaps not the safest-looking bit of Bogota...\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe thought we'd have a relaxing first day, what with the jetlag, lack of sleep and altitude sickness. So Dan signed us up for a 3 hour walking tour. Dan and I have different ideas about 'relaxing'. But after some grumbling and repeating the words 'altitude sickness' over and over until they lost all meaning, I had to admit that the tour was pretty great. Our guide brought us all over the region of Candelaria. Dan and I arrived too early for the tour and decided to walk around ourselves a bit first, thinking hm, Candelaria isn't so nice is it... But when we joined the actual tour we realised we'd been one street away from all the pretty bits, possibly in those bits we were meant to stay away from. The tour started at the Museum of Gold (Museo de Oro) which thankfully we didn't have to go to as it sounds very boring. We walked around quaint colonial Spanish streets and drank a traditional altitude sickness cure that looked revolting but tasted pleasantly citrusy. We went to a Botero art exhibit. He's the Colombian artist who painted the proportionally exaggerated large people. I wasn't a fan but there's something sort of endearing about the fat Mona Lisa.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bogota/candalaria1.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nPretty streets that we totally missed when walking around by ourselves\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bogota/candalaria2.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThese leaves silver with age, just like people\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bogota/candalaria3.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nGraffiti is legal in Bogota.

He said he couldn't refer to him by name in case locals misunderstood as the tour was in English. But he was happy to answer questions if we referred to him as You Know Who, a suggestion he said came from a British couple who were big fans of Harry Potter. Having not watched Narcos myself, I didn't know much about him, so the tour was delightfully informative. Apparently he turned himself in under the condition that he could build his own prison in Medellin. So he built a fancy mansion, transferred all his prison friends there and had a load of parties.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAll our fellow walking tour tourists told us we had to go up Montserrat, a mountain visible from the city below. Don't worry, there's a cable car. We couldn't go the following day, Sunday, because floods of locals go up to the church on top for mass and it's meant to be a bit of a nightmare. So as soon as the tour finished at 5.30 we hurried to the cable car, managing to just get up for sunset. It all seemed extremely fortunate until we tried to get back down and had to wait in a queue for over an hour as the cable car only took about 10 people at a time.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>I love a cable car though.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bogota/cablecar.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bogota/park.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nCreep shot of this couple having a romantic picnic\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>On our second day, we thought we'd go to some parks. There's a cluster of parks about an hour's walk from Chapinero including a Botanic Gardens. The route in was not pretty. Outside of the tourist areas, Bogota is fairly run-down. But the first park was nice. It was a Sunday, so there were lots of families having barbecues and renting pedalos on the lake. I had a grim experience on a pedalo in Sicily once. It was in the sea, and Dan decided to jump off and go for a swim, but the pedalo relied heavily on weight-distribution and I can't swim. So I sat huddled in the centre with my eyes closed until he came back. I hate pedalos.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      The next park was closed because there was a massive rap concert on. But the botanic gardens were good. Not sure it was worth the walk in, but there wasn't much else to do in the time we had. We asked an English-speaking waitress in the cafe how safe it was to get a taxi back. A look of grave concern darkened her face and she told us she'd order us an Uber. Ubers are technically illegal in Colombia, but maybe if the taxi drivers stopped scamming people I'd feel worse about it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bogota/gardens.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nYou'd think we'd have a better picture of the Botanic Gardens but most of our efforts were concentrated around getting back from the Botanic Gardens once we arrived\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOn our third morning, the morning we left Bogota, I woke up feeling great. No headache, no dizziness, no exhaustion from walking up a flight of stairs. My altitude sickness had cured itself just in time for us to drop a thousand feet.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I also finally learned which syllable of Bogota you're meant to emphasise.

That was all the convincing we needed. A couple of years ago I watched a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4CKb2qbKWZLWYStnhBB7GFF/five-massive-reasons-you-should-join-dara-and-ed-on-their-great-big-adventure\" target=\"_blank\">TV show</a> where Dara O'Briain and Ed Byrne travelled around Central America and ever since thought Costa Rica looked great. So our holiday plan: 9 days in Colombia (Bogota, Medellin, Cartagena and Santa Marta) and 9 in Costa Rica (Aranal, Manuel Antonio and Drake Bay).\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In the lead up to our holiday, Dan asked me several times if I owned a light jacket. Of course I own a light jacket, I said, brushing the question off as though ridiculous. Two days before the holiday I realised that yes, I do own a light jacket, but it's khaki. That may not seem overly problematic until you consider I was also packing 2 pairs of khaki combats. A khaki jacket with khaki combats would portray an entirely unrealistic image of my outdoorsy abilities, and should we end up in a jungle survival situation, I certainly didn't want the other lost tourists turning to me as a leader. As soon as they found out I'd only ever attended one Cub Scouts meeting and refused to go back on account of the excessive amount of team sports, they'd turn against me and refuse to let me eat any of the berries. But obviously I'm writing this from Bogota so I won't keep you in suspense. I dug out my old favourite red jacket that is now about 75% underlining as most of the red material has peeled away. I think in aforementioned jungle survival situation, this jacket portrays the right image. 'She looks capable, with her River Island combats, but she probably couldn't wrestle a boar with her bare hands. Sort of a middling member of the group.'\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Jacket finally sorted, we were ready to go. After a few rather worryingly tender goodbyes from friends and family (\"You've always been a good friend you know\", \"I'll miss you\", - muffled sobbing - , and from my Spanish friend \"Give the kidnappers my number and I'll negotiate in Spanish with them\"), we set off.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The first lesson I learned on this trip, was that no matter how much cheaper it is, don't EVER get a 6am long haul flight. We got up at 3am, flight to Paris, stopover for 4 hours, then a 10 and a half hour flight to Bogota in what were objectively the worst seats on offer. Middle row, one from the back. The entertainment system offered Beauty and the Beast and the remake of Baywatch 4 times. I saved Baywatch for the return flight. We arrived in Bogota about 20 hours after waking up that morning, but having only slept for 3 hours + horrible half-awake plane sleep in the last 2 days. In our foggy haze, Dan bought a $10 bottle of water in the airport and we kept the receipt as a fond reminder.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The next day we woke up unsure if we were dying, but adrenaline-filled enough to go and investigate Bogota.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAfter a year and a half in Edinburgh, I'm assured I'd still not be mistaken for a local as I don't yet detest the Edinburgh Fringe. I also don't understand pies. Why does everything here have to be a pie? Meat pie, Scotch pie, breakfast pie, chips pie. I don't know.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I kind of get the Fringe animosity. For the month of August, Edinburgh turns into a permanent festival. Except that this festival is mostly made up of students trying to give you flyers. I sometimes felt there were more flyer-distributors than there were Fringe visitors. Initially I tried to take the flyers because at least I knew I'd recycle them. But after walking through Quatermile a few times and finding myself physically weighed down by the four tonnes of paper I'd accumulated, I decided to adopt an avoidance strategy. I've been told that, to put it mildly, I'm not particularly approachable. I have one of those faces, affectionately known as '<a href=\"http://www.dailyedge.ie/resting-bitch-face-2163269-Jun2015/\" target=\"_blank\">Resting Bitch Face</a>'.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>'What's wrong?' people always ask.<br>\r\n        'Nothing. This is just my face.'\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It turns out the only people in the world who DON'T think I have RBF are Edinburgh Fringe Flyer Distributors.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>For the first week, our friend Bunch was visiting. So of course we went to as much Fringe as possible. I think by the end he was feeling more jaded by the Fringe than most of the locals. But we soldiered on.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Fringe has some weird stuff. I was lured in to a show that promised an interactive murder mystery. So excited was I by the words 'murder mystery' that I somehow totally ignored the 'interactive' part. Now, substitute 'interactive' with 'mandatory audience participation' and 'murder mystery' with 'at the end she randomly took all her clothes off and demanded someone tie her to a chair'. To be fair, the audience at the show were utterly awful at participation. It was as if the whole audience was made up of multiple versions of me.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>My friend Sam attended a show where the solo performer felt the need to ask that the audience not refer to it as a sex show, because that's technically illegal. So that will give you an idea.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Among my favourites was 'Seance'. High on the weird scale, you and 15 other people go into a shipping container, with one long dining table down the middle. It's decorated sort of like an old Victorian dining room. You each have a set of headphones that you put on, then are plunged into total darkness for 20 minutes while a purely auditory stereo seance takes place. The stereo quality was perfect, so the imaginary man leading the seance sounds like he's moving from person to person, and you just know there'll be a voice right at your ear at any second.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>A benefit of the Fringe is that virtually every building in Edinburgh turns into a venue. That nice old church you always pass? A venue. Basement of that grimy pub you once had to drink in? A venue. The communal hallway for your flat? Also a venue. This means that you can visit all the buildings you always wanted to see into. One of my favourites was the vaults. There's something so mysterious about walking in a door and immediately going down stairs.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Despite my initial enthusiasm, I wasn't sorry to see it go in September. After a while this sense of guilt starts creeping in. How many times have I seen the poster for That-Comedian-I-Like and I still haven't gone. The crowds get a little irksome. Idea for next year: Special travelators for residents who just want to go to Sainsburys to do their shop.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/fringe/mannequin.jpg\">\r\n    <p>In a terrifying twist in the <a href=\"../post/78\">Manny tale</a>, there was a headless mannequin on top of the Seance shipping container for the whole month of August. Just down the road from my flat. Coincidence?\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nRecently, I've been veering towards vegetarianism, something sure to make me deeply unpopular with meat-eaters and actual vegetarians. I was a vegetarian for a couple of years when I was about 17 (and 16 or 18 I suppose, by that logic). I wasn't fond of lentils or beans, so my diet was mostly roast dinners with the chicken scraped off. Ultimately, I ended up with a lot of headaches and one day on my way home from Marks & Spencer with my mum, I ate some packaged chicken. It was over.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Until now. Sort of. Unfortunately, I still don't like lentils or beans. But now I'm 30 and more sensible. I realise that only eating potato, while charmingly Irish when living in Scotland, is not very good for me.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I've managed to get on board with pretend meat. While the faux chicken and mince isn't really fooling anyone, it's quite manageable. The chicken nuggets are by far the closest, which really says something about actual chicken nuggets. So now I'm a much better almost-vegetarian than I was when I was 17 because I eat potato and fake chicken nuggets.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I thought I'd try get into chickpeas. They taste like nothing, but have a weird texture. It's not like meat, but it's not really like vegetables either. So maybe the idea is that your brain thinks 'not vegetable - must be meat' because obviously there are only 2 possibilities in that scenario. Anyway, I bought a packet of them in Sainsburys. I've only ever had them in ready-made salads so I didn't really know how to buy them. I assumed they came ready to eat, like peanuts.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>They didn't.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The packet instructions say to soak them overnight in a big saucepan. The next day you boil them for an hour, then leave them to simmer. Then drain them.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When I finally got round to reading these instructions, about 2 months after buying them, I obviously went to throw them in the bin. This isn't famine-era Ireland. We don't soak our porridge oats for 3 days anymore. I'm used to the convenience of pre-washed lettuce in a plastic bag.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Poised for dropping them in the bin, Dan suddenly interrupted me. He demanded we give it a try. He then amended that a bit and said he would give it a try and I didn't need to be involved. So he put the whole lot in a saucepan and left them to soak.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The next morning, they had taken over the kitchen. Perhaps in retrospect, the whole packet was a little extreme. Especially for 2 people who don't even like chickpeas very much. But never mind that now. We still had hours of toil to go. The boiling commenced. 7 days later, the shipping container of chickpeas was ready for consumption.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I tried one. As expected, it didn't really taste of anything. I Googled 'how the hell do people eat chickpeas' and found some roasting/herb suggestions. Into the oven, doused in herbs. Removed from oven. Slightly crispier, still didn't taste of anything.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      Now the remaining chickpeas have been lovingly poured into tupperware where they may sit in the fridge for about 6 weeks, until we finally give in and throw them away. The tupperware box is massive, to accommodate this ridiculous quantity of chickpeas, so we're going to have forgo some other stuff. Like milk and butter, and that half an onion perpetually wrapped in clingfilm.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/chickpeas/chickpeas.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAs a child I was obsessed with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Goosebumps_books\" target=\"_blank\">Goosebumps books</a>. I easily read at least 40 of them. Looking back I find it quite remarkable that the R.L. Stine managed to come up with so much horror content when I struggle to write one blog post a month. My favourite was Say Cheese and Die. When our protagonist takes a photo of her friends with a weird camera, some of them have blurred faces and then they die. Or something. Actual no one ever died I think because they were aimed at children. They always had a great twist at the end. The twist was usually that the protagonist's little brother managed to get hold of the Magic Cursed Thing and so would repeat the whole cycle.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There was one called something like \"Oh no my dad is a Plant\" where the protagonist's dad turns into a plant. I couldn't stand not remembering the title so looked it up just there. It was actually \"Stay out of the Basement\". Which is better than \"Oh no my dad's a Plant\" because the latter actually gives away most of the story. I'm a little disheartened though because as an aspiring writer I know the pains of coming up with a book title. If \"Oh no my dad's a Plant\" can cut it, I might not have much to worry about. On the other hand, \"Oh no my dad's a Plant\" isn't taken. So there's that. Hope you're all looking forward to the inevitable success of \"Oh no my dad's a Plant\" by Anthea Middleton, a rollercoaster sci-fi comedy thriller that will awkwardly have one really weird reference to a plant dad wedged in to try and make the title fit.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Cuckoo Clock of Doom. What a title. I think that was a time travel one. The Blob that Ate Everyone. Imagine him pitching that. 'So I know it's one month (seriously! May 1997 - June 1997) since I published \"Don't Go To Sleep!\" but I've got a great new idea. Hear me out. <i>The Blob that Ate Everyone</i>.' 'We love it.'\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Anyway the point of that rather lengthy Goosebumps reverie was that I'm now living in a Goosebumps book. Let me be clear. Sometimes I like stories, but that doesn't mean I want to actually live them out. This is an especially important point because one of my favourite genres is bleak British detective novels about grisly murders. One notable exception to this rule is of course Harry Potter. At aged almost 30 it's getting more and more awkward to receive my Hogwarts admissions letter.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We live in a ground floor flat. Across the street, there's a row of flats that sort of mirror ours. From our window we can see straight into across-the-street-and-up-one's sitting room. At least I assume it's their sitting room. Possibly their wiccan ritual room, where they sometimes also sit. No one else can really see into that room because a tree blocks the flats to either side of us, and if you move closer you're too close to see up.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There's something weird about that room. Have a look at this picture we took one night.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/manny/manny1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p>\r\nDo you see it? How about now?\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/manny/manny2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p>\r\nBit of a weird shape eh? How about now?\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/manny/manny3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWhat in blazing hell is that? That room has nothing in it, except one bare mannequin (who we've called Manny to try and make light of the otherwise horrifying situation). This has been the case for months. There's no lamps, no couches, no table, no decoration. Just Manny. They leave the light on and the curtains open every night so we, and only we, can see their freakish bald mannequin. He's in the centre of the room too. I know this because once someone walked in behind him.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I really want to go over, ring their bell, and say \"Hey, what's with the mannequin?\" But Dan rightly pointed out that because we're living in a Goosebumps book I can't do that. Inevitably they will say \"what mannequin?\", show us their perfectly normal couch-TV-lamp-bookcase sitting room and send me home, whereupon I'll look in our window from the footpath and our sitting room will be entirely bare, apart from one large bald mannequin.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "description": "One day, I opened my Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series (the name is important in case any poor soul decides to buy this mechanical travesty of a laptop) to find the screen was coming away slightly from the casing. I thought \"I should really investigate that\" and being a normal person, I did absolutely nothing about it.",
    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOne day, I opened my <i>Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series</i> (the name is important in case any poor soul decides to buy this mechanical travesty of a laptop) to find the screen was coming away slightly from the casing. I thought \"I should really investigate that\" and being a normal person, I did absolutely nothing about it. Over the next few weeks, the problem got notably worse. In order to open the laptop I had to open it a little, wedge my thumb in at the hinge and hold the screen down. Once open, I could usually pop the screen back into place. Was that the sound of cracking plastic? No probably not. I'm sure it's fine.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then finally, about 6 weeks after the first signs of deterioration, the laptop wouldn't open. When I tried there was an almighty cracking-plastic noise and the screen was being bent, coming about 2cm away from the casing. I tried my clamping-it-in-place-with-my-thumb trick but to no avail. The force on the screen was too much.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>That very evening, Dan who has the same laptop, bought a few weeks after mine, reported that the screen had started to come away when he opened it. Now I know sometimes people have a warped, favourable self-perception, but I'm quite sure that I'm careful with electronics. I'm generally careful with everything, except my phone for some reason. I don't know why but I'm forever leaving it precariously perched on the couch arm and hearing that horrible \"phone just dropped\" sound. But other than my phone I'm a very careful person. Almost boringly so. And so is Dan. So let's just assume that we haven't been carrying the laptops around open, holding them by the screen.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>They were both out of warranty but I thought this is a manufacturing fault that Dell will fix for free. All the forums said no, Dell will tell you that this is normal wear and tear. In fact the Dell website says that any damage to the screen at all is considered normal wear and tear, even within warranty. Undeterred I went onto their support section. Surely, I thought, if I tell them that two laptops belonging to two very careful people had this manufacturing fault at the same time they'll be reasonable. Well I'll never bloody know. Because to get to their help you have to run a diagnostics check. I shouted at my dad's laptop (which I was using to contact them) that diagnostics aren't going to fix a broken hinge but it was no use. There was no option not to do it and doing it just said that the service tag didn't match. I could have got a monitor and keyboard for the Dell and done it that way I suppose, but by now I was ready to pull the thing apart.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There's an awful lot of cracking-plastic sounds involved with dismantling the <i>Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series</i>. It's deeply unsettling. But in the whole process I managed to only break off one tiny tab. Anyway I got the first few bits off, hard drive and battery out, then onto prising the inner casing off. But it wouldn't come off. To Youtube! Youtube guy says to turn laptop over and take out the keyboard, because the inner casing is screwed into it. BUT MY LAPTOP WON'T OPEN, I said to him. He didn't listen.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>My dad, conveniently a mechanical engineer, suggested we implement a more serious version of the clamping-it-in-place-with-my-thumb method. Using a metal ruler and a lot of care, and a lot of wincing, we managed to get the top up and took out the keyboard. Carefully labelling all the screws and stacking all the parts (see? I am really careful) we got down to the hinges.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The problem seems to be that the hinges are far too tight. They put an inordinate amount of pressure on the screen, gradually pulling it away from the casing. Once it dislodged from the casing, the already very-tense hinge, which had come loose from its own casing, just kept pulling it further and further. I'm not sure if the screen was originally glued into place. No glue was obvious.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>At this point I would have gracefully admitted I know nothing about hinges and thrown the whole lot in the bin (or resentfully paid Dell a load of money to fix something they broke in the first place). Fortunately my dad knows loads about hinges. He suggested we loosen off the nut on the hinge so it has barely any tension at all. The other hinge was easily tense enough (that's future Anthea's problem) to hold the screen up. We put some epoxy into the broken hinge casing, holding that better in place. And the last step, which was easily the most nerve wracking, was to drill a hole in the screen casing and screw the screen into place so it wouldn't come away again.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I was easily convinced. My reasoning being that the thing doesn't work anyway, so why not. We weren't going to drill through anything other than plastic and the metal casing. There was a horrible shudder when the drill hit the metal and I did rather worry that it could have dislodged something. We then sanded off the end of the screw with a Rotozip.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I rather wish in the reassembly I'd noticed that every layer labels the screws you're meant to put in. Because it's not quite as simple as just putting screws wherever you see them. In some cases the outer casing is screwed onto a part that's only exposed after you've taken out everything else. But for anyone interested in disassembling their <i>Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series</i>, the screws you're meant to use on each stage are written down.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So eventually we got it all back together. The hinge worked (better than ever, which really made me realise how crap it was to begin with. Why would you have a laptop where you have to pull the top of the glass screen to open it?) and the laptop still switched on and has sound and wifi and everything. And most remarkably, not one screw left over.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There are many lessons to take from this experience. Look at Youtube first. The order of assembly is probably written on the casing. Don't let things deteriorate into unusable before you try to fix them. And don't buy the <i><i>Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series</i></i>.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/dell/dell1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nDell has seen better days\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/dell/dell2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nWhen you eventually get to the hinge, loosen it off.

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWhat good is a brand new amp for your stereo system if you don't immediately build some sort of switch comparison circuit to test it against another amp?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>My parents got me a new amp - an Onkyo A-9010 - for my sound system for Christmas. I had one (Rotel RA 972) that was good once upon a time. Though the volume control was always a bit finicky and for the last 4 years it sometimes only played out of one speaker. Fairly unbearable for an audio snob. The sound had been degrading slowly over time, but it was so gradual that I wasn't even certain of it until I came home and heard my Dad's stereo.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Around 30 years ago, my Dad bought his amp - a Sharp Optonica SM 4100. It must have been top quality because other than some crackle with the volume control it sounds perfect to this day. There was no real point testing my new amp against my old amp. By comparison, my old amp sounded like whatever band playing had decided to record in a tiled bathroom full of custard.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The real test was my Dad's amp, against my new amp, using the same speakers and audio input (an iPod. Speaking of which, that iPod is about 8 years old, still has good battery life and functions like it did when new). We chose Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd for the test. Very familiar and excellent sound quality. But the test environment was flawed. Wiring the speakers up the old amp was a particularly long process, whereby you sort of bend the wires in a loop, hook them over the pot and screw them into place. My tired, old amp is the same and it has always baffled me that such an archaic system is still used. Having exposed copper wire that you have to manoeuvre is not a user friendly experience. The newer amp is slightly more sophisticated, but still not speedy. Anyway, for the test, we'd wire up the speakers to one amp, plug in the iPod and play Comfortably Numb for a few seconds. Then stop it, unwire them, wire them into the other amp, switch over the iPod and start everything up again. Then play Comfortably Numb. But the whole thing took so long that we'd sort of forgotten what the first one sounded like.  We concluded my Dad's amp was better but also concluded that it wasn't much of a test.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So we wired the both sets of amp speaker inputs into 4 switches (Speaker 1 left, Speaker 1 right, Speaker 2 left, Speaker 2 right) and connected up the speakers to the common. This meant switching all four would change the speaker input from one amp to the other. The only issue was the source (the indestructible iPod). But unplugging and replugging that was really only a matter of about 5 seconds.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/amp/circuit.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nI haven't managed to capture much here if we're honest. But that's the circuit anyway.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/amp/setup.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThis is the full setup.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThen the test. Comfortably Numb (which I am thoroughly sick of) on the old amp for 15 seconds or so. All off, switch, change source, all on. Comfortably Numb for another 15 seconds.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n    <p>They're the same.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

But it doesn't matter, because I will soon have a new, Scottish Cliffs of Moher. And it's called... Arthur's Seat. The difference between the Cliffs of Moher and Arthur's Seat is that I did at least once want to visit the Cliffs of Moher.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIn fairness, I've only been to Arthur's Seat twice. Someone in work told me that it was more of an amble than a climb. You kind of saunter up it at a leisurely pace in about half an hour. After my first trip I stormed into work to confront him and he denied ever saying such a thing. He insists someone else said it, or I imagined it. But whatever the case, someone told me it was just a stroll and it is in fact a gruelling hike (I'm told that I don't really know what a hike is and that if I ever had to do one I would probably die. Either from exhaustion or because my companions would murder me to stop my complaining).\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nYou can see Arthur's Seat from most of Edinburgh, which made it rather embarrassing when we got up there and I'd thought this whole time that it was a different hill. I thought it was the ledge bit, not the pointy bit. On our first trip we walked from the base and with great victory I marched to the ledge, proclaiming myself a pioneer of physical fitness. Then someone said 'no, this is only halfway. We have to go up there,' and pointed to a much steeper, more treacherous hill, the same distance up again.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThen a few months later my cousin and her boyfriend came to visit. 'Don't tell them about Arthur's Seat' I said to Dan. She's a personal trainer and he's in the army. Needlessly to say, they're a little ahead of me fitness-wise. But due to it being distinctly visible from anywhere that isn't obscured by a tall building, they immediately spotted it and asked if we could climb it on Sunday. I tried to say don't be fooled, it's not the ledge bit, but that just seemed to make them more enthusiastic.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIt's grand though, because the second time we sneakily drove halfway up.

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>I'm not great with plants. I like the idea of growing my own herbs, like Jamie Oliver, but it never really looks like Jamie Oliver's herb garden. I once kept a parsley plant alive for about 9 months but really, for the last four it was practically begging me to let it die. I never even use parsley. Once every few months I'll make garlic bread and put some parsley in the garlic butter. Do you know how much parsley is required for garlic butter? One leaf. One leaf of parsley every 3 months and I kept that plant alive, though miserably, mostly brown and shrivelled, for the best part of a year. In fact, I only let it go when I moved out of the flat. I wanted to bring it with me, let my mum keep it alive while I was in Australia, but she threw it in the bin.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Basil is more useful. I'd definitely have more of a use for basil. Except my basil plants always get that basil plant disease, which I'm sure is a thing, and isn't just 'The disease of Anthea-can't-keep-plants-alive'.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So I gave up on basil.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I had a lettuce plant. Nothing will really bring home how little lettuce you eat like owning your own lettuce plant. Lettuce didn't get a plant disease. Lettuce just died after a week. I tried gently placing him in the garden to see if the outdoors would perk him up. I went back out to check on him a couple of days later and he'd completely disappeared. Were our neighbours really so stuck for lettuce that they came in and stole our dead lettuce soil lump from our garden? Someone suggested slugs but it's pretty mysterious.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The most horrifying plant story however, involves Clint. I bought a mint plant a few weeks ago and called him Clint. Dan always had a bad feeling about Clint. He said he thought there were an unusual amount of tiny flies around him. I told him he was being silly and the flies were simply attracted to Clint because of his minty magnificence.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Clint was to be my greatest plant success. I used his leaves more than any other plant I'd ever had. Put them in water, put them in potatoes... Well I used them twice. Anyway, he grew and grew. He was actually getting so large that he started to take over the windowsill and we were worried that one day we'd wake up and he'd have acquired sentience. I'm pretty sure I once caught him stealing an orange from the fruit bowl. It was possible we'd accidentally bought a triffid. He was doing so well that my confidence in plant growing prompted me to try parsley again. So I bought another parsley plant. Dan named him Ian Parsley. He sat next to Clint and they seemed to get along amicably, but the point is, we'll never know who's to blame for the horrors that follow. Dan insists Clint but really it could have been either of them.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>One evening, Dan went into the kitchen. Then he called to me. 'Um... There is a problem.'\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>OH MY GOD CLINT IS DEAD. IAN PARSLEY HAS ATTACKED HIM. That was my first thought. Then I thought the dishwasher had leaked. Then I thought the freezer had defrosted. Then I thought I'd better stop thinking and just go in and look because Dan was starting to sound hysterical.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>About one thousand flying ants had appeared on our window.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Dan theorises that there was an ant nest in Clint's soil. I have to admit, the flying ants really did seem to centralise on Clint. As you can imagine both Clint and Ian were unceremoniously thrown out the window. I don't want to say how we dealt with the ants because I'm worried people will tell me that we dealt with them wrong and that what we did can somehow only mean we're going to get even more flying ants.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But it was a miserable few hours with a vacuum cleaner and a can of hairspray.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There were a few stragglers for the next couple of days, but no more swarms. Clint and Ian Parsley are now dead. And with them died the dream of my ever owning another kitchen plant again.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Jamie Oliver doesn't get flying ant infestations in his herb garden.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

Three months ago we Googled hotels. Most of the major hotel/accommodation sites don't list Cuba, presumably because of their American affiliation. Internet advice said to avoid hotels anyway because they're very expensive, and shoddy. Stay in a Casa. A Casa is someone's house where you rent a room and they vary a lot in quality. We found a highly recommended one on Airbnb but when we tried to click 'Book', the button wasn't there. Then we noticed the little message saying \"The service is not available in your country.\" Airbnb only allows Americans book Cuban accommodation. I have no idea. Anyway we got around it using secret techniques and managed to book Casa Havana, an old Spanish mansion-style building with double height ceilings and huge antique creepy furniture. The hall was long and dark and full of poltergeists. Our room didn't have much in the way of windows but it was perfectly pleasant and clean. Most importantly it had air conditioning. They also gave us breakfast every day, which was nice considering the rather sparse and bleak food supply in Cuba.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/havana/homestay.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe stayed in Vedado, the region famous for gambling mafia hotels pre-revolution. Fidel didn't like those so he turned a lot of them into dismal apartment blocks, but some are still hotels minus the mafia and the gambling. We ate in one on our first night. Lonely Planet advised on lots of restaurants but we couldn't find any, and it had said that hotels were a bland but safe option. The safe part proved dubious on our last day when Dan succumbed to a food-related illness - the only one of our whole trip.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nVedado is shabby but charming and the old hotels are grandiose and tacky, with their decor never advancing past the 50s. The bigger ones will sell you a one hour Internet voucher for anything between 2 and 10 dollars. How badly did we need Internet? Not very badly at all, as it turned out. Though we did pay once midweek to look up where the hell the ATMs were.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/havana/vedado1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/havana/vedado2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/havana/vedado3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\n'Happy holiday!' or 'Hey where you from?' are phrases we heard a lot. On our first day we walked along the Malecon - a road adjoining the sea, towards the city centre. Two locals wished us a happy holiday and when we didn't immediately shun them, fell into step beside us. Where were we going? What were our plans? Don't go to the city centre, it's being fumigated for mosquitoes today. The lady told me about a free salsa class, only on today, just round the corner. I kept saying no we had plans and they kept following us. The man was trying to sell Dan cigars. They had to leave us alone eventually because they couldn't very well man-handle us into the salsa class. This happened many times, and it's hard to be blunt because inherent of Irish politeness. But I figured I'm doing them a favour because they don't want to waste their time either. It's not reasonable to say they're scam artists, but they do want money. It might be for drinks at a free gig, or for a meal at their cousin's restaurant, or for their mate selling cigars. As far as they're concerned you're a wealthy white tourist who's probably willing to shell out for stupid stuff. And that's fair enough. But that's not to say that it isn't really annoying. We found a suitable response was to smile politely, mumble something intelligible and walk away briskly. Sometimes they'd persevere a bit but if they shrugged and said okay I immediately felt guilty. Maybe this one person did really care where we were from.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/havana/malecon.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe Malecon.

Residents leave their doors open so it's impossible not to look. The decor is almost always old-person-wallpaper and a picture of Che Guevara. But the people are a cheerful, sociable bunch. The locals are always chatting, partying, listening to music or sharing an amorous embrace on the Malecon. It's easy to be deceived into thinking maybe money isn't everything. Until you talk to a qualified doctor who tells you he works as a handyman in the tourist industry instead because as a doctor he earned the equivalent of 30 dollars a month. The enormous queue outside the American embassy was also something to behold.

Morro Castle is at the other side of the bay so we paid for a vintage Ford sedan to bring us. \"Morro Castle my good man,\" were words he completely ignored as he slowed to a stop outside a house, about five minutes from our destination.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\"This is the only restaurant nearby,\" he explained. \"Good food.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It didn't look like a restaurant. It looked like a house with a man outside. Either way, we weren't hungry. \"Just Morro Castle thanks,\" we said.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He didn't move. Told us some more about the food in his friend's house. Explained again that this was the only restaurant. We tried a few more times to suggest Morro Castle and eventually I said, despairingly, \"Please just bring us to the castle.\" He seemed to feel bad then because he agreed. As he moved off I saw him shrug to the guy sitting outside, who shrugged back and waved good naturedly.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\"I can bring you on a tour around the area. One hour.\" He tentatively suggested, before reaching the castle. We were probably not considered a successful tourist fare.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>We had a look around the castle. Good views across the bay. Some nice stone work. Then we realised it was only 6pm and the cannons weren't on until 9. We found another bored tourist, Gary, and together embarked upon a mission to not eat in our taxi's friend's house until 9pm. There was a restaurant, with an actual sign up, a bit down the road. The food was extortionate so we ordered some water and greatly irritated the staff by making it last two and a half hours.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/havana/morro1.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/havana/morro2.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe cannon ceremony was lengthy. A lot of choreographed walking and candle lighting. It went on for about 45 minutes and culminated in a rather unspectacular cannon noise.

The number might be more skewed towards modern in reality, because we had a tendency to block them out. The fanciest cars are usually taxis, and charge more than the boring modern taxis. It's awfully fun to ride around in them.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/havana/cars1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/havana/cars2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/havana/cars3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nI was more interested in these.

And I mean a level of difficulty above the usual \"picky eater travelling\". They don't have much to offer, except ham apparently. A lot of ham. Most things come with ham and they seem to substitute their lack of other ingredients with more ham. The quality is pretty low, chips taste like canteen chips cooled and reheated in a microwave. And there's no fast food options because no USA influence. There are very few shops, and if you do find one there are two problems: Firstly it'll sell a weird variety of useless products (we could never see bottled water). Secondly they usually don't accept our currency. There's a dual currency system in Cuba. One CUP is worth 1/24 of one CUC. As tourists, we could only get CUC (worth roughly the US dollar). Apparently if you queue for hours in a bank you can get CUP but it never seemed worth it. So the shops won't accept CUC anyway. We couldn't buy snacks, and had to get bottled water in restaurants and hotels. I'm sure there are ways around this but with no Internet we couldn't look it up. We found a good place in Centro Habana called the Sandwichera. They made yummy sandwiches, albeit with a lot of ham.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe didn't mind not having Internet. It added an extra challenge. That said, we'd have been completely lost without our Lonely Planet Cuba book, kindly given (lended, in case they read this, we will give it back) to us by the Irish couple we met in Guatemala. It was funny walking by the huge hotels and seeing the crowds of people, Cubans and tourists alike, sitting outside on their laptops, tablets and smart phones. Which is worse; China, where the Internet is readily and easily accessible but heavily censored, or Cuba where the Internet costs several dollars an hour in very select locations, but has no censorship? I'd argue Cuba I think.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/havana/guide.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

You're like a gazelle in a lion's den. Men everywhere shout about taxi offers, mostly with no discernible uniform. You battle your way through the multiple taxi stands to find the one official Trip Advisor recommended one, which never quite matches what they told you. 'That looks sort of yellow, and the name is nearly the same', you eventually reason and desperately clamber in, convinced you're being taken for a chump.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur hotel was in the Historical Centre, which is full of lovely old stone buildings. They gave us a map of good central sights to see, which we ignored and immediately took several subways out to a large park called Chapultepec. Not really sure where we were going, we paid some money at a gate and found ourselves in a palace with lots of paintings. All the descriptions were in Spanish. No idea. The building was nice.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/mexico/historicalcentre.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nTrip Advisor rated the nearby Anthropology Museum as an absolute must, some particularly enthusiastic tourists saying you could spend an entire day there. I was sceptical, because museums are very boring. We went anyway of course. 24 rooms detailing the beginning of humankind, then a bit of a gap, then Mayans, then Aztecs. There were a lot of artefacts in glass boxes and lengthy descriptions. I remembered the name Cortez from Pirates of the Caribbean (after Dan remembered it, and told me that I must remember it). You could spend a day if you were a museum sort of person. I did find myself wondering when humans first decided to cover up their lower regions, but the museum yielded no answers. I'll put that in the Trip Advisor review. \"If you're wondering when humans decided to first wear underpants, this is not the museum for you.\" I meant to look it up when I got back, but forgot. Now I'm writing this from Cuba which has no Internet so I may never know (I should clarify that there is Internet in Cuba, but you have to go to a large hotel and pay 2 dollars an hour. To find out more, you'll just have to read my Havana blog post).\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe found a restaurant that served pasta (one of the 3 staple things I can eat while travelling and incidentally one of the 3 things I'm never going to eat again from December onwards). With a lot of loud gesturing I tried to ask if it was spicy. While rummaging around to find our phrasebook, a man at the table next to us translated. She waitress said no, I said good. It burnt my face off. I think she thought I wanted it spicy and asked the chef to add a few chillies.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nNot content with one set of Mayan ruins in Tikal, we went to another set called Teotihuacan about an hour out of Mexico City. I thought they were the ones Karl Pilkington visited on An Idiot Abroad, but a quick Google revealed that to be sadly not the case. We got 2 subways to a bus station, then looked for the Internet-recommended bus. None of the busses said 'Autobus', as we were told, but several men assured us this was fine. So we got on one that had Playboy Bunny stickers everywhere and a smashed up front window. I was a little dubious but we couldn't find anything else and it did have Teotihuacan written on the front. The price was also what we read. It did make a rather surprising amount of stops in tiny local towns, but got to Teotihuacan in less than an hour so we were happy enough.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThis site was much more intact, but I preferred the jungley, half-uncovered feel of Tikal. There were two huge main pyramids representing the sun and the moon (one of very few facts I remember from the anthropology museum). You can climb up the original steps, rather than added manmade ones like in Tikal. I imagined they've been a little enhanced for safety. At the top you get a rather spectacular view of the enormous city.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/mexico/pyramid.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nPyramid from the bottom\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/mexico/topofpyramid.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nPyramid from the top was swamped with tourists doing weird hand wavey things\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/mexico/viewfrompyramid.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nLovely.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOn the ground, there are about 50 people selling this thing that makes a tiger noise. 'Haha, who would ever buy that?' I laughed to Dan. Everyone. Everyone buys that. Some guys had a crowd, all queuing to buy a tiger noise device. What a great souvenir to remind you of your time at a Mayan temple. A tiger kazoo.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe went back to the road and a much sleeker bus pulled up. This can't be ours, we thought. Probably a private tour. The driver got out and shouted 'Mexico City' and ushered us on. Charged us the same rate. No Playboy stickers, perfectly intact window, air conditioning, a toilet AND 'Autobus' was written on the front. I have no idea what bus we took to Teotihuacan. We stopped in a town about ten minutes away and a policewoman with a bullet-proof vest and a frown got on and stormed down to the back, rummaged around, looked concerned, and got off. Were we supposed to have bullet proof vests? Were they, perhaps, under our seats? If an armed guard is going to get onto the bus I'd much rather they stayed there. Getting on, storming around, looking concerned and angry then getting OFF did little to put our minds at ease. This is typical of Mexico. There are police absolutely everywhere. Even in the lovely tourist city centre. There's usually at least 2 on each street corner, at least one directing traffic at every set of lights, and if you go out a bit there can be up to twenty per street corner. All armed. All with bullet-proof vests. A guy we met on the plane on the way out of Mexico told us that the police are one of the biggest problems, that they're threatening, extremely corrupt, and will shake people down for bribes indiscriminately.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nXochimilco. I don't really know what it is. We were advised to go there so we got a subway and a train. The train drops you off in a rather seedy looking suburb, miles away from anything. We thought we were being so clever getting public transport. There was a sign to 'Xochimilco dock' so we followed it for several streets. We arrived at a grim looking brown canal, crammed full of colourful rickety boats. 20 nearby boat salesmen immediately started shouting at us. We'd read that you didn't have to get a boat and could just look around so we tried to follow the canal, but the side street sort of ends and you're just walking around this dodgy suburb. The boats were completely unappealing so we gave up and got the train back. During this time we found out that Dan's phone wouldn't switch on anymore. We tried everything, including a new battery. Luckily we were going to Cuba the next day, where a smart phone is pretty useless.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/mexico/xochimilco.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/mexico/church.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>We got to go up the big cathedral on the square, which was nice. We didn't realise it was a tour and kept wandering off, until one of the guys working there told us we had to stay with our group because the police were watching (nice). We explained that we had no idea because we don't speak Spanish and didn't understand the tour so he took it upon himself to give us an entirely English tour. That was nice.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <h3>Anthea's Advice</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\nIf you decide to go to a South/Central American country that speaks Spanish, learn some Spanish. You'll get by with gesturing but sometimes it's really difficult and everyone assumes you will at least have some basic words. Even if you say you don't understand (\"No entiendo\") they'll continue to talk to you in fast Spanish. We were very fortunate that a woman we met in Guatemala gave us her Latin-American Spanish phrasebook as she didn't need it anymore. We'd have been lost without it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

This one is particularly scenic and you can watch Fuego erupt a bit every few minutes. The first time I saw it (it's just puffy black smoke) I panicked, wondering why no one else was panicking. Should we run for it? Was lava about to consume Antigua? At least would there be a problematic ash cloud blocking our way to Mexico? No one seemed fussed so I relaxed and watched it in peace.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nGetting to Antigua, like getting anywhere in Guatemala, was not straightforward. We got off the boat to Panajechal and tried to give the driver money. No, he waved us away, give it to that guy. He pointed vaguely up the dock. So then a teenager stops us holding a wad of cash and asks for the money. We hand it over and continue onwards. Then an old man stops us and asks for the money. Using a lot of gesturing we explain that we've already paid and assume this is fine. A few minutes later in the bus station, he ran up to the window and started gesticulating wildly. A nice girl translated for us but it was pretty obvious. We hadn't paid. We brought him back down the dock to explain but the teenager was gone. The guys in charge of the boat told us to wait and eventually sourced the teenager. Initially he seemed to be denying any knowledge of us and the money but for some reason he gave in and the matter was sorted. I'm too impatient. I'd been arguing the whole time that we should pay them twice.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe got to Antigua late afternoon, just in time for a free salsa class. The sign said 'Free salsa class at 5pm on Tuesdays'. It seemed too good to be true but we were ushered into a tiny room, along with about 15 other people, and taught some beginner salsa for an hour. We were utterly useless and there weren't enough women so had to rotate partners. I ended up with a decent Guatemalan who could actually do some salsa. It was good for me, but a total waste for him. Good thing he didn't pay.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/antigua/salsa.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThese guys lured us into the free salsa class by being good salsa dancers\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAntigua is filled with ruined churches.

And if I did it was only because everyone had told me I'd definitely be mugged at gunpoint, not because of anything that actually happened. If you're stupid and walk around juggling your wallet and your iPhone at midnight outside the pretty town centre, yes you may get into trouble.

While researching the trip, Trip Advisor said that Panajachel is the most touristy one. Dan found a highly recommended hotel on the lake called Casa Del Mundo but I argued that it wasn't in a village, and it would be too difficult to see anything. In the end we compromised and spent one night in Panajachel, and two in Casa del Mundo. Dan was right. The night in Panajachel was a bit of a waste.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nPanajachel is a town comprised of tuk tuks, tourist tat, coffee shops and restaurants. I found it pretty charmless though out of all the lake towns we visited it was certainly the most tourist-friendly. In order to reach the other towns (and Casa del Mundo) you have to take a boat. The public boat goes when it's full and costs between 2-4 euro, depending on how good you are at haggling. When I write that it looks pathetic, because when you're there you're dealing with quetzal. So it's between 15 and 25Q, which seems worth haggling for.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/lakeatitlan/panajachel.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nCasa del Mundo is beautiful. It's built up into the mountain so wherever you sit you overlook the lake and the volcanoes. At night they offer a meal 'family style' where you get to pick meat or vegetarian, and you sit with everyone else who's staying there. This is all great, except I couldn't eat the food. I sort of poked it around my plate and then ate a Nature Valley bar later. Everyone else seemed to like it but I'm not quite in the Latin American food zone yet. We met another lovely Irish couple who lent us their Cuba guidebook and offloaded their remaining Cuban currency. I only hope that when we leave Cuba we find someone to offload our otherwise completely unusable currency.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/lakeatitlan/casadelmundo.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/lakeatitlan/mountain.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/lakeatitlan/hammock.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nYou can use the public boat to do a little tour of the lake towns. We went to Santiago, the furthest, first. You're only off the boat and everyone is shouting at you to get you onto another boat to San Pedro. We fought our way through the hoards of boat salesmen and a slightly deranged looking man called out behind us, in good English. 'Any chance you guys are going to the US?' This seemed a legit question so we turned back to him. He had a ripped 20 dollar note, he explained, and no one here would take it. That's also true in Guatemala. We said no sorry. He asked if we were Irish which was a good catch, but something still seemed weird. After a couple of minutes he took out a little squishy ball and an almost empty bottle of goo. 'It's empty because I've been healing people all day,' he said and started to rub the little ball on Dan's arm. 'Erm, we have to go,' we said and edged away warily. He called after us asking for a few dollars for the bus. I felt bad. But really, what was going on there? Did he genuinely have a ripped 20? Was he just waiting for Dan to take out his wallet so he could grab it? Was that supposed to be some weird magic trick? If so he needs to work on his intro...\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nSantiago isn't overly touristy once you get away from the dock. There are some churches and a statue called Maximon, a Mayan folk saint who gets moved around. You can go visit him and give him a cigar. We didn't. Some other ladies staying in our hotel did though and said it was all a bit weird.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/lakeatitlan/santiago.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe got the boat from Santiago to San Pedro. The streets are tiny (only tuk tuks fit) and it's on a very steep incline, which of course we climbed. The view is good. We went back to the dock thinking we'd go to San Juan, which was on the way back to the hotel. A very confusing conversation with the boat guy took place, where he said there are no boats to San Juan, only his friend's tuk tuk. We asked about a boat to Casa del Mundo and he said no, you must go from San Juan (at least that's what I thought he said, as I say it was very confusing). The upshot was he bundled us into his friend's tuk tuk. We agreed on 25Q for the 10 minute trip. The driver was awfully nice and suggested spots to take photos. When we got out Dan asked if he had change and gave him a 100Q note. He gave back a 20 and a 5, I assume hoping we'd think the 5 was a 50. Dan pointed out that he owed us 75Q and he sort of grunted and gave him another 5. This continued until we eventually got to 60 and gave up. Before leaving he told us we can't get a boat to Casa del Mundo from here, have to get a tuk tuk back to San Pedro. He wasn't wrong.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/lakeatitlan/sanpedro.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nSan Pedro\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/lakeatitlan/sanjuan.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nSan Juan\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/lakeatitlan/journey.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nFrom San Pedro to San Juan via tuk tuk\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe later it gets, the choppier the lake gets and by the time we were on our last trip I had to remind myself a few times that I don't get seasick.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      It gets a bit wearisome dealing with the boat and tuk tuk drivers but the lake and surrounds are so beautiful that it's completely worth it.

One couple told us we were absolutely guaranteed to be sick the entire time we were there. This did not fill me with optimism.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nChicago was too cosy, easy and Western. It felt like we'd finished travelling when we arrived. This, combined with everyone's ominous warnings, made it tough to brace myself for Guatemala. We also still hadn't gotten over the Vietnam to Chicago jetlag so were sleeping terribly and felt sick most of the time. All in all, leaving Chicago for Guatemala was one of the tougher parts of the trip.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe literal trip was no picnic either. Flight to Houston, 4 hour stopover. Flight to Guatemala City arriving at 10pm. Our flight out to Flores (because we weren't going anywhere near Guatemala City) wasn't until 6am the next morning. Originally we planned to hang around the airport but we felt so utterly awful that we checked into an airport hotel for 4 hours. Extravagant spend. Completely worth it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe arrived in Flores feeling like death and spent most of the day sitting outside reading or sleeping. We did venture for a little walk and managed to see the town in its entirety because it's tiny. Flores is a sleepy little picturesque island town, surrounded by lake. And importantly, it had a very cheap laundry. A cheap laundry service is invaluable for travelling.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nEveryone who lives in Flores is a tour guide. As you walk the 7 or so streets people constantly suggest you pay them to walk with you. While I'm sure it's steeped in history, a tour guide for this miniscule town seemed a bit excessive. We did see one rather miserable looking group of ladies following a man who was gesturing to buildings telling them what colour they were: \"So you see here, this building is red, which is a very popular colour in Flores.\" About two hours later when we were eating dinner on a terrace we saw them walk by on the road below, looking more miserable and frustrated than ever. There's only so many times you need to be told what colour something is. If you don't show interest in paying these guys to tell you the water level in the lake, they offer you weed instead. We took four flights total in Guatemala (US to Guatemala City, GC to Flores, Flores to GC and GC to Mexico) and had our bags \"randomly\" searched every time. I thought this was a bit weird until I realised that they probably have loads of white people buying weed in Guatemala.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/flores/streets.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nPretty little rustic streets\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/flores/cat.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nWe made a cat friend at dinner.

When we were first organising this months ago, I Googled it to see what Tikal looked like in its hey-day. I used to be obsessed with this point-and-click PC adventure game called Quest For Glory as a teenager, and in the third one (Wages of War) you're in a fictional African city. I was pretty excited when I found the image:\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/flores/tarna.png\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n<a href=\"http://questforglory.wikia.com/wiki/Tarna\" target=\"_blank\">Tarna</a>, where I traded a honeybird feather for a poison antidote and bought rope from the thief merchant\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/flores/tikal.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n<a href=\"https://septisphere.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image_of_a_mayan_city.jpg?w=625&h=349\" target=\"_blank\">Tikal</a>, where my attempts to trade with a honeybird feather were, quite frankly, met with derision\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIt doesn't look like that anymore, but that's okay because it's still nice. Sadly they allow you to climb a lot of the pyramids (not up the proper steps, they put staircases in). They also provided lunch which is tough at the best of times, but in Guatemala I was on high alert after all the horror stories I'd heard. I was ready to hungrily drink my bottled water while everyone else ate but in the end I caved and it was probably the nicest meal I had in Guatemala. And no repercussions.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/flores/realtikal.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

Willis (formerly Sears) Tower is the tallest, but my well travelled friends assured me there was a better view from Hancock. What I forgot was that everyone, without exception, gets ID-ed. What I also forgot was my ID. There was a group of women, easily 50+ in the queue who all had to show ID so they were certainly not letting me in.

South East Asia, boiling heat, mosquitoes, no one speaking English, then suddenly cold, easy, Western Chicago. I would have much preferred to put Chicago at the end but our friends Laura and Niall were very inconsiderate and had their wedding on the 7th of November. That said, if it weren't for Laura and Niall's wedding we wouldn't have bothered with the second half of the trip in Central America.

The first people on don't arrive earlier. Is storing your luggage next to your seat so important that you want to sit on the plane for an extra half hour? When we were all assembled on the plane we sat twiddling our thumbs for an inordinate amount of time before the pilot announced that someone had been taken ill and subsequently taken off.

Unfortunately I was sick. I made it through Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia with no severe issues but 2 days in Chicago and I had a crippling stomach ache. In retrospect I think it was from the flight and jetlag, but at the time I was sure I had a stomach ulcer and appendicitis and certain death. I thought I was putting on a brave face but people probably realised something was amiss when I'd turn to Dan and loudly whisper that I thought I was dying, as if I was a character in a movie capable of soliloquy. Everyone started asking me how I was feeling, even new American acquaintances and I felt hugely embarrassed. Anyway it wore off a bit and the wedding was great. Laura's American friends and family were extremely friendly and everyone looks good dressed up, which is always nice.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe were sad to leave South Bend.

A woman stopped us and pointed at her friend, who was selling tickets to this bridge. We could see the bridge from the street so this seemed weird. It looked like the bridge led to the Old Town sector, but the whole town looked old to me so that didn't clear matters up either. Scepticism shields activated we retreated only to find an unmanned narrow alleyway that led into the Old Town so we snuck in thinking we were very sneaky and great. How will we get back out? What if they ask for tickets? Well the other end of the street was completely unmanned. So conclusion: Scam. We didn't dwell because there were too many nice lanterns.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/hoian/alley.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nSneaky laneway\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nHoi An is where we found Al Frescos. This is a Western chain in Asia that serves yummy food for Anthea. We ate there both days with no regrets. Pizzas, burgers, soups. Not a rice grain in sight. At night we passed some brave Westerners eating in the street food stalls. Good for them I say. I've had a lot of people gripe at me for my attitude towards eating local food. I'm not interested in food. Food is sustenance that helps me sightsee and do daily tasks. I don't like new exotic foods so why would I risk losing precious days to food poisoning when I get absolutely nothing out of it? If fellow travellers want to immerse themselves in street food and diarrhoea that is entirely up to them. I don't tut and judge. It's just not for me.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThere's a lot of tailors. And by a lot I mean that there are at least 4 long streets comprised exclusively of tailors. The rest of the streets have a tailor every third shop or so. We met a Norwegian in Saigon who smugly stated he got a really good suit for $300. Norwegians are too used to expensive stuff. Another guy we met got his for $120. I really wanted a dress but it would have taken two days minimum.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe cycled out to An Bang beach but it rained sideways so not a lot of sunbathing there.

The walls were glass. For the couple that no longer cares for romance while travelling. Luckily the huge window facing the bed had a discretion curtain. But the door (which only faced a little hallway) was a pane of glass. With a courtesy frosted square in the centre hiding one tap on the sink. Who designed this? Who wants this? I got so angry that I Googled it and found this is a major problem nowadays. Hotels with glass boxes for bathrooms. Especially in China.

Neither of our phones work. But why is phone the only option when you're logging in from a foreign country? Loads of phones don't work in foreign countries. Why not email? Why not email Westpac? To Hell with Westpac. We paid with credit card and got lumped with all the fees.

It sometimes crops up on those 'Travel Must See' lists. However it was rainy season. Which means, due to flooding, the 7km trek becomes a 4km trek. And while less trekking makes me happy, it was a pity not to see the one part we booked it for. All the other people we saw that day did the 1km walk, through the artificially lit part with a walkway. We felt very smug when we got to the end and our guide led us through a little gate into the blackness. 'Where are they going?' we're sure they all asked, with great envy. At the end we were given lunch. I hate when tours include lunch because I can never eat it. I'd pay more for a tour not to include lunch. Especially because it's always 'traditional' so if you don't eat it you feel like you're insulting Vietnam as a whole. Then Dan jumped in the freezing cold cave water while I pointed a torch at him so he could see. He says he enjoyed it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phongnha/cave.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nIt's really difficult to take a picture of this cave\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phongnha/caveswimming.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nYou couldn't have paid me to jump in there\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe outdoor evening cinema was showing an utterly miserable film called Heaven and Earth that night. The films always have a Vietnam theme, which is fair enough, but this was too much. Wall to wall, relentless sadness. I'd give it 4 out of 10. The outdoor cinema was great and at a particularly poignant scene one of the Farmstay dogs jumped straight up onto my stomach, causing inappropriate laughter all round.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phongnha/cinema2.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe were sceptical when Ben, the owner of Farmstay, told us to see another cave. He was very insistent so off we went. You get a boat down the river, and sometimes you'll see a load of tourists who need extra people to fill the boat so they pay less. We didn't know anything about where to go, other than the location of the boat port.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWhen we arrived a large group of Vietnamese people, about our age, bustled us over to a ticket office shouting 'You need to buy tickets!' over and over again. It was confusing because we knew we had to buy tickets, so why were this group jostling us so much? We had no idea so just went with it. Then they bustled us onto their boat, which had 2 remaining free seats, so that made sense. Not one tourist in sight, which was not what we were expecting. They gave us some sandwiches so we figured it was probably ok. Since we had no idea how long the boat ride was we just sort of waited. It pulled up at a port and one of our new friends said \"We just have to sign some papers, be back at the boat in five minutes\". What? Do we have to sign papers? Are they going to sign our papers for us? Then they all got back on the boat, paperwork presumably complete, and we went into the cave.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe cave has a river running through and for our portion anyway was completely lit up. I liked it a lot more than Paradise Cave. The boat brings you to the end and back then lets you off to walk around up from the river. As soon as we got off our new friends seized us and took about 20 photos of and with us. We chatted the whole boat ride back, as a couple of them had decent English. On arrival they invited to us to a local beach but we had no mopeds this time so rather regretfully had to bid them goodbye.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phongnha/pier.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe pier\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phongnha/cave2.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nPhong Nha Cave\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phongnha/chums.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThese guys were great\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      We cycled to the Pub with Cold Beer, which is so far out into the countryside you're certain you must be wrong. Luckily there are signposts for it everywhere. Some tourist discovered it and now all the local hostels promote it. It's more known for serving very fresh chicken than cold beer. I wasn't keen on choosing a chicken and watching it meet a grisly end. I prefer to keep a level of detachment from my food. So we didn't get any chicken. But Dan said his beer was cold.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phongnha/pub.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe cycled back to the Farmstay for many hours, and en route met a group of guys who were having their own beers outside a house. They beckoned us over, took some photos, and kept offering us beer. We eventually managed to leave and got back in time to see that night's movie, the much more cheerful The Sapphires.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phongnha/chums2.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe met an Irish family in the Farmstay and Dan's mum used to live almost next door to one of them when they were kids.

We learned by watching locals and this is no exaggeration: To cross the road you first find a zebra crossing. No one will stop for you so you trust that they drive around you. At any given time you'll have 50 scooters flying in your direction so you weave and they do too. It takes a while to get across but don't stop. Stopping confuses them. Shuffle slowly and carefully. Then there you are. At the other side. Unscathed, but dripping in trauma sweat. Sometimes there are pedestrian lights but these are more a guideline than a rule. Because of the vast density of traffic many scooters seek a handy shortcut on the footpath and ironically this is the only place they won't bother to weave around the bewildered pedestrian.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/hochiminh/crossroads.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nYou could watch for ages at a safe view point.

What would such a trip be without a visit to a war memorial museum? The War Remnants Museum is devastating as expected. There's a floor dedicated to war photographers so you can imagine how harrowing that was. They overdid the anti-American sentiment though. The whole thing was horrific enough. There was no need to add blatant anti-American bias everywhere. It detracted from the integrity a bit. Outside you could buy novelty Viet Cong soldier hats. I saw a large white tourist wearing one later that day.

Our second day was a trip to the Cu Chi tunnels by boat along the river. These were tunnels that the Viet Cong used to hide from, and generally outwit the Americans. The tunnels were miniscule. To give tourists an idea, they actually had to be widened because we'd never fit in them, being so big and fat by comparison. One part of the tour let you walk through for 50 metres, though you could leave each 10 metres if you couldn't hack it. I couldn't. Even widened it was horribly claustrophobic. I lasted 10 metres. Dan did the 50 and he's about 11 foot tall.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/hochiminh/basilica.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nSaigon Notre Dame Basilica\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/hochiminh/postoffice.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nPost Office\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/hochiminh/park.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nPark\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <h3>The Eyelash Saga</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\nBefore leaving Melbourne I had this great idea to get eyelash extensions. That's when they glue big black plastic eyelashes onto your regular eyelashes with superglue so it looks like you're always wearing mascara, and you always look fabulous. In theory. 3 weeks after their application, in Ho Chi Minh, it all started to fall apart. Left eye looks great. Beautiful evenly spaced long dark lashes. Right eye is somewhat more... Sporadic. Large clumps have fallen out of the centre, taking my own lashes with them. Where they remain they stuck together, pulling on my regular lashes, causing swelling. I gave up and decided to have them removed in one of the many beauty salons. Either that isn't a thing in Saigon or they had no idea what I was talking about. No one could help. They look absurd. I've done some Googling and will provide updates on potentially disastrous home remedies. Then a further update on acquiring a snazzy pirate eye patch.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

We had the scooter for 48 hours so getting any other form of transport was out of the question. That thing cost us 5 dollars a day. Trip Advisor said to go to the caves, or go to Kep (a nearby town), or even Rabbit island (an island absolutely miles away). The caves sounded really boring, Kep was too far and Rabbit island was without question too far. If we couldn't follow Trip Advisor advice what would we do? We were at a loss. Should we just sit in our room and cower, eaten up with guilt and shame at not doing the Trip Advisor Top Ten for the two days we spent in Kampot?\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>We pulled ourselves together and decided to bring the scooter out for a wander. Our hotel map marked somewhere called 'Coconut Hill'. All of the Internet said it was far too treacherous on a bike but someone in the restaurant said it was grand, so that was good enough for us. As it turns out, the Internet was exaggerating, though not by much. The road was bumpy and dusty but there wasn't much traffic and we were in no hurry. We ambled about the pretty orange and green countryside, taking more photos of grass and eventually got to the hill. We couldn't go up the hill but the road kept going, so we did too. Then it got to the sea so we figured we'd better stop. It was great fun, much better than a stupid cave.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/kampot/orangeroad.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/kampot/dirtroad.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/kampot/shelter.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.rikitikitavi-kampot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rikitikitavi</a>, the hotel we stayed in, deserves a mention. You can't find it on the usual booking sites but it's highly recommended by the Internet. It's run by an English/Dutch couple. Dom, the English guy, rode his bike from England to Cambodia (he cheated in India and had to fly) for a number of years, then decided to stay and open a charming hotel. I was particularly impressed by their restaurant because on the menu they say \"We use only purified water to clean salads and dishes and keep to the highest hygiene standards\". It was here that I abandoned my attempts at eating Asian food. I'd been doing okay up until now. I didn't eat meat, but ate a lot of rice and vegetable stuff. However I did have a pretty permanent stomach ache so thought maybe what I really need is a burger. And ate burgers 3 days in a row. I felt much better.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nDom had an impressive DVD collection so in the Cambodian spirit we watched Apocalypse Now and Tomb Raider.

Now it's a museum chronicling the Khmer Rouge/Pol Pot genocide. It's well laid out, keeping some rooms similar to their previous states, usually accompanied by an utterly horrible photo of what they found when the prisoners were eventually released.

Turns out his family of 12 were forced to leave Phnom Penh when the Khmer Rouge took over (they told everyone there would be an American air strike) and made for the Thailand border. Over the course of their reign half of Soda's family died, either by starvation or murdered. The most sickening story he told us was about his eight year old brother. Their mother grew corn in the garden, presumably for the government. Soda's little brother was seen taking some and was captured and killed. What do you even say when someone tells you a story like that? Soda went on to play soccer for Cambodia's national team. He said people still recognise him.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe Killing Fields were sites of mass murder during the Khmer Rouge regime. The one we visited outside Phnom Penh was actually quite serene. Your entrance fee gets you an audio guide. This tells you that a lot of the structures and buildings were torn down, so what remains is a rather peaceful park. From time to time bones and teeth come to the surface. The most awful part was the Killing Tree. Google it if you're interested, but be prepared. In the centre is a monument filled with the skulls of the victims uncovered. Each skull has a sticker denoting a best guess at how they died.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phnompenh/killingtree.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe Killing Tree\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nNeedless to say that trip rather hung over our time in Phnom Penh. Aside from that, as a city it's okay. Busy, full of people shouting their offers of tuk tuks. All the paths are crammed with tuk tuks, mopeds and cars making it treacherous to walk. We visited an enormous sprawling market called Central Market and Dan bought a shirt. It took a long time for him to convince the stall owner than he wasn't a size XXL. Even when he tried it on (at her insistence) and almost wrapped it around himself twice, she wasn't convinced.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phnompenh/market.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phnompenh/street.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

It has no skyscrapers, and for the most part the buildings are quite spaced apart, so it seems more like a big town. The streets are wide, though jammed with scooters and tuk tuks. It seems the only way to avoid having 10 men shout 'Tuk tuk?' at you as you walk is to actually be IN a tuk tuk. Pub Street and the Art Market are at the very centre. They're touristy but sometimes it's ok to be touristy. All the eateries were clean, and I bought a t-shirt in the market. I did try hard to get one that didn't say 'Cambodia' on it, but no such luck. So now I'm that person who wears their Cambodia t-shirt back in Ireland.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/pubstreet.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/pubstreetmarket.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAngkor Wat is a large formerly Hindu and presently Buddhist temple just outside Siem Reap. Throughout history its religious affiliation has changed depending on who's in power. We hired a tour guide. When you're limited in time it's much easier, and things cost nothing in Cambodia. He turned out to be a former Buddhist monk and spent much of the tour trying to convert us to Buddhism. We read to cover shoulders and knees as always, men included this time, and when we met him asked was our attire suitable. He looked sadly at my t-shirt and said the sleeves might be a bit short. I specifically read that a t-shirt was fine coverage so I think he hated shoulders more than most.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAngkor Wat is spectacular. I liked it because it was all stone, with no gaudy gold or painted decor. Walking around it felt like being in a computer game. Someone else must've thought this too, because one of the other temples in Angkor (there are 85. No matter how beautiful, that is too many temples) was where they filmed Tomb Raider. Our guide wasn't mad about the Tomb Raider temple, probably because of the media hype, but it was my favourite. Angkor Wat is much better restored and in great condition but the Tomb Raider temple belongs to the jungle now. It has huge Strangler Trees growing through it that have now become integral to its structure. I did a hilarious computer game running and jumping motion for much of our Tomb Raider tour.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/angkorwat1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/angkorwat2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/angkorwat3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/angkorwat4.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur second day we again opted for a tour. This one was of some local villages, a real market (as opposed to the tourist Art Market), and one of the famous floating villages. This tour was wonderful and a little sad. The villages show a different picture to Siem Reap city centre. At one point we veered off the road into the jungle to see an abandoned temple. En route about 20 tiny children joined us, climbing on the backs of our bikes. I was terrified I'd crash but she wasn't having any of it. Our guide Chantha explained that he always brings stuff for the kids like sweets and pencils for school. Heartbreakingly he told us that he meant to bring them some schoolbags this time but forgot.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/temple.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThey all loved Dan because he flung them around the place\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/market.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nA real market\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/countryside.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nPretty countryside\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAfter dropping the kids back (they tap you on the back when they want to get off the bike) we drove to the floating village. The houses are all either on stilts, or actually floating as boats so that they can survive the wet season. Chantha told us that in wet season they fish, in dry season they're farmers. They often have to completely reconstruct their houses after wet season. We ate lunch in a lovely lady's house and then took a boat down the main street of the town out towards the lake. I couldn't help but notice that the religious temples were by far the most structurally sound, expensive looking buildings. As always.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI found it strange to think that we in the West work in offices to save money so we can go to Cambodia and stare in fascination at this poverty-stricken floating village. In a way it's nice to see simple living, and their wooden houses on stilts out in the river. But really, all those little kids needing schoolbags is very sad.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/floatingvillage1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/floatingvillage2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/siemreap/floatingvillage3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      On a more cheerful note we went to the circus that night. Usually I hate the circus, but this was more a Cambodian Cirque du Soleil, so no clowns. All the acrobats came from a school of performing arts that takes on disadvantaged kids and trains them.

One taxi and they're all metered. Easy.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe stayed for two full days and if 'novelty' isn't really your thing, this is plenty. Bangkok took elements from big sky scraper cities, and from the seedy run-down massage parlours of smaller towns in Thailand and mixed them together in a rather unpleasant cocktail.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur first day took us to some temples, because we'd forgotten how tiresome boiling hot temples get. We took two trains and a river boat (Bangkok is big) and met some backpackers who invited us to sightsee with them. This completely hindered any productive sightseeing we had planned, but was probably a lot more fun. These backpackers (8 of them) taught me that travel-wise I am a complete baby. They were all travelling solo (two girls amongst them) with no plan. 'Where to after Bangkok?' I asked one of the German girls. 'Dunno, maybe get a bus to Chang Mai. Might go to Burma next week.' We had quite literally three spreadsheets of planning for this trip. We booked every flight, every bit of accommodation, researched every bus/taxi/tuk tuk drive. And I marked each cell off green once we had completed the booking. These backpackers had no spreadsheets. Just free spirits. A guy came up to us Khao San Road (big touristy street) selling scorpions on a stick. They all dived right in, while Dan and I tried not to gag. They did say it was like eating a very thin shell and not much else.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bangkok/scorpions.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bangkok/market.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nTrying to sightsee with eight people is impossible, and after half an hour we'd lost all but 2 of them. The four of us went to see Golden Mount. It's large, decadent and features some gold (though mostly white). I found this style of temple rather gaudy. It's impressive I suppose. We tried to go to the Grand Palace but were told it was closed. We were suspicious because a well known scam is for someone to stand near a tourist attraction and tell you it's closed. Then you say 'oh no! What will I do?!' and he suggests something else, then he's leading you to his friend's tuk tuk and you're on a tour of all his mate's shops. So we didn't believe him. But he was right. It was closed.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe got the boat back at rush hour. It was completely packed to the rafters, there may even have been people hanging onto the rafters for dear life. They only pull up to the pier for a very minimal amount of time so you have to really push to get on before he leaves. One guy got on but his little daughter was left on the pier. Out of panic he grabbed her as the boat was pulling away. He didn't have a good enough hold and she nearly fell down into the water, right by the mechanism. Luckily the ticket lady hauled her in, then gave the dad a good hard slap in the face for being such an eejit.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bangkok/boat.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nDan and new backpacker friend Abate cling onto the rafters of the boat for dear life, while I risk death taking this photo\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bangkok/soycowboy.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nGlitzy with much nudity\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>As it was dark when we got back we thought we'd see the fabled Soi Cowboy street (also, conveniently it was right behind where we were staying). Soi Cowboy is a street of neon and strip clubs. The ladies sit outside in bikinis with numbers attached and beckon you in. The doors are often open a teeny bit so you can see a teaser of a pole dance. I'm glad we saw it. No need to go back.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      For our last day we tried to see the bits we missed previously because we were too busy faffing about with the backpackers. Reclining Buddha and the Grand Palace. Both large, white, decadent and not very nice. Outside the Reclining Buddha temple, a guy in a 'uniform' told us it was no use going in now, prayers are in session and we won't even be able to see it. Contrary to our well-meaning friend of the previous evening this guy was a outright liar. Anyway, this Buddha is so giant that no amount of praying Buddhists could really obscure your view.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThey really don't like shoulders or knees. I covered my shoulders but foolishly left my sexy knees exposed so always had to don some sort of enormous unflattering dressing gown. I thought Buddha was meant to be laid back but when it comes to shoulders and knees he must've just flipped out.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bangkok/palace.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThis is either the palace or a temple.

Do people buy these? Do tourists buy them? How does anyone transport them? Why are there so many shops selling them?\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bangkok/buddhas.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe key to good interior design is a blank canvas with subtle accessories\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nA rather interesting stop was the house of Jim Thompson, an American stationed in Thailand by the CIA in WW2. He loved the place so much that he decided to live there, and as an architect built a beautiful Thai-style mansion in Bangkok. He set up a silk business and became even richer than he already was (which was pretty rich to start with). The interesting part is several years later he went on a trip to bangkok and was never seen again. No sign of his body. I tried to solve the mystery by looking for clues in the house but the tour guide asked me to stop.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bangkok/jim.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIt would be terrible to go all the way to Thailand and not see Bangkok. It has character. Dan liked it more than I did. He was endeared by its rather rough edges, and liked how they didn't try to hide away the grimier elements, like Shanghai or Singapore. I see his point but am not enamoured. Still, you don't have to like a place to enjoy it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

Check-out day presented us with a bit of a pickle. The last boat back to mainland Phuket was at 3pm, and our flight left at 10.30pm. We had four suitcases and once back on the mainland had nowhere to leave them. I guess we could've made enquiries but short of a police station I don't think I'd have trusted anybody to look after them. To make the most of our day, we thought we'd rent a moped again in the morning and zoom around Ko Yao Yai (it turns out there's only so much sitting on the beach I can do. One day is my maximum. Even then I started to feel a bit agitated and guilty for not optimising my time). Then, like an 80 year old, Dan threw his back out trying to weigh my suitcase. Nothing hospital-worthy, but he couldn't ride a moped. And I couldn't with him on the back.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nInstead, we walked down the beach and back inland - the only way to actually get out of our hotel. Once we left the confines of the hotel we were back to the usual shanty village with shouting taxi and tuk tuk drivers. We met a very nice lady working in a clothes shop. She had almost perfect English (very unusual) and told us she'd been to university in Bangkok and was now back in her hometown running this little tourist shop. I bought a bracelet off her and she taught me how to say \"that's too expensive\" in Thai. She thought I needed the help.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/koyaoyai/beach.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe beach\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/koyaoyai/village.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe village\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/koyaoyai/beach2.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nPhew back to the lovely beach.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAfter the boat and taxi, we spent 5 hours in the airport, but the wifi was good and I got to update my blog.

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThere is a world of difference between what you get when you Google Phuket and what you get when you go there. The airport is in the North, and we were staying in Kata, in the South so we got a colourful and expensive taxi drive down through the island. With each decrepit poverty-laden town we passed through I started to get more and more sceptical about my Phuket research (which consisted of Googling Phuket and looking at the pretty images).\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/google.png\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nGoogle\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/phuketreality.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nReality\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur (admittedly very cheap) hotel had looked great in the pictures though, so I was excited to see the landscape change as we arrived. Only it didn't. We drove through Kata and up a very steep hill passed an abandoned crumbling football stadium and arrived at reception. To be fair to the hotel, it was perfectly nice, and very close to Karon Beach (although it somewhat led you to believe it was on Karon beach).\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/hotel.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nKerb appeal.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOn our first full day we asked the guy on the desk would we be better off turning left or right at the end of the road to have a look around. Left led to Kata, right to Karon. He said much better to go to Karon. Lots to see there. I guess there was stuff to see. Tattoo parlours and shops selling knitted beachwear are stuff. We gave up after a while and went back, deciding to try Kata instead that night. There's infinitely more to see in Kata so we decided that the guy in the hotel probably had some friends selling stuff that he wanted to steer us towards. There is absolutely no other reason he would say Karon over Kata. This, we decided later, was the first of many mistrustful incidents we would encounter. It felt like you always had to have your guard up. Everyone was trying to scam you at any opportunity. You think you can trust your hotel, but two of them told us to go to Karon.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nKata is okay. It's quite similar to towns in Bali, though compared with Ubud it's not as pretty. I would say it's like Ubud but without any of the colour, greenery or temples. Unfortunately if you took all those out of Ubud you wouldn't be left with much. Every third shop is a 'massage parlour' with 5 suspiciously beautiful women sitting outside beckoning you in. Maybe it's because we were in low season, but these were always empty. In fact everything was empty. This was even stranger in the bars. Kata had no shortage of bars but we eventually noticed that they only seemed to have one beautiful barmaid, and maybe 3-5 of her beautiful friends, all of who shout \"hello, come inside!\" at you from the street (some with deep voices). We were not naive enough to think 'wow these people are friendly'. Kata, as towns in Phuket go, doesn't seem to be particularly seedy, but even there we walked down a street exclusively dedicated to prostitute bars. I felt quite sad when I got home that night, because everyone laughs about this and makes light of it but the reality must be pretty unpleasant for all the girls involved.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/mopeds.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nMopeds everywhere\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/karon.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nKaron beach was very pretty\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/wires.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nSometimes these tangles of electricity wires fizzed and sparked\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOn a lighter note there was an absolutely fantastic dinosaur themed bar with dinosaur mini golf. I'd never played mini golf before and resisted, saying to Dan that if we played mini golf in the Dino bar we were becoming the loud middle-aged Australian tourists who come to Phuket purely to lie on the beach and play mini golf. He told me to lighten up. It was fun and the amount of effort that went into the theme was amazing. I've honestly never seen a themed pub/event/anything done as well as Dino Mini Golf.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/dinogolf.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe next day we went on Captain Mark's Big Boat Tour around Phang Nga Bay and I got to see where all the Google images come from. Phang Nga Bay is spectacularly beautiful. I started to warm to Thailand as soon as we left the pier. Our tour was only 6 people, 2 other young couples. The first stop was Lawa island where we were allowed to splash around in the crystal clear sea. Our tour was clever because it always timed its arrival before or after the giant tour boats. One arrived as we were leaving and about 50 people disembarked.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe took little canoes under very low caves (one girl emerged with a bleeding head) and sailed around the inner opening. My favourite part was the Mangrove Forest, accessible only through a cave. I felt very adventurous trudging through foot-high water. The last bit was Boomerang Hong (our tour operator claims to have discovered this island, though obviously other people have discovered it since as it was mobbed). We had to paddle our own canoe here, which everyone seemed to think was great for some reason.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/beach.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/boat.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/mangroves.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/jumping.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThat night we met some of our fellow tour groups for a drink. We first chose the Hollywood Bar because it had pretty fairy lights and was playing Dire Straits. Nowhere offensive has ever played the Dire Straits. It was only after about half an hour we realised that we were the only customers, other than the usual pretty barmaid and her 3 pretty friends. They seemed very confused when we tried to pay for our drinks and leave. If you aren't safe in a Dire Straits environment I don't know what to think.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nNext we went to the Art Bar, which our new friends assured us had no prostitutes as they'd eaten there yesterday. It was run by a lovely guy and his tattoo artist wife (everything in Phuket is a something slash tattoo parlour: Tourist info/tattoo parlour, zoo/tattoo parlour, go-karting/tattoo parlour, fire station/tattoo parlour). And their utterly awful child. He was about 3 and made his presence known when I came out of the toilet. He was just standing outside the door, staring at me. I said hello and asked his name and he ran away screaming. A few minutes later, he ran up to our table and started throwing ornaments and arranging them, usually grabbing my leg in the process. Okay, haha, we laughed. We helped him arrange them, then waved bye. But he was going nowhere. He pushed himself up onto my knee and kept giving me ornaments. When I took them he'd grab them back. Eventually Dan picked him up and tried to put him down on the other side of the table, whereupon he locked his little chubby legs around the table and started screaming. His dad came over and asked if he was annoying us. Not at all! Because we're super polite. He gave up in the end and decided to run away scream-crying for the rest of the evening. I think I'd prefer the prostitutes.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/restaurant.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThis kid.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur last full day in Phuket did not go as planned. Our tour friends told us to rent mopeds and ride around the south of the island. I was not enamoured with this idea so we looked up alternatives and saw that longtail boats can take you there too. We walked to Kata beach to enquire, but sadly they only run in high season. I caved and agreed to the moped. After agreeing to pay 250 Baht (100 Baht higher than we'd been told, but no one haggles), the man asked for a passport as deposit. We were pretty unhappy to hand over a passport but made our peace with it as the day was wearing on at this stage, and trudged back to our room. We thought we'd be clever and give him my Australian one, because at least I have a spare if anything went wrong. He rifled through it and handed it back. No stamp. If I crash the bike I could leave the country. His logic was sound (though their system has an air of a threat about it) but at this point it was 3pm and it gets dark at 6 so we gave up. We sat on the beach in a huff for the rest of the day.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe following day we had to get a boat to Ko Yao Yai, but there was no reason to go too early so we decided to give the moped another shot in the morning. We dragged our suitcases into the hall and asked for help bringing them to reception. I sat outside the room with the door open waiting, when 2 of the staff arrived, following closely by a maid. She asked if she could start cleaning the room, while the 2 men fussed over the bags. I said yes, she went in, and emerged about a minute later (2 men still fussing) and said 'Where is the other silver spoon?' I stared at her blankly, having no idea what she was talking about. She showed me a set of 2 cups and 1 spoon. 'It's missing?' I asked. 'Yes, 2 silver spoons. Where is it?' Obviously I had absolutely no idea where it was and she took on a rather antagonistic air. Eventually I asked if she was accusing me of stealing it and she said yes. Nothing happened regarding the spoon but when I thought about it later there was only one of two reasons that incident happened, and neither is nice. Either she thought a teaspoon is something worth stealing, and that I might actually have done so. This indicates she puts a pretty high worth on a teaspoon, and that she'd get in a lot of trouble if it went missing. The second possibility is that she stole it, hence why she waited until there were 'witnesses' and ran out almost immediately to accuse me. In both scenarios she thinks a teaspoon is worth stealing, and that's rather depressing.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe finally managed to rent our moped, and crashed it into a ditch after ten minutes. We hauled it out and examined it for scratches, but it was in such a state to begin with that we couldn't really tell. I was keen to just give the damn thing back (we'd already stopped to take a picture and not been able to restart it until we rolled down a hill) but Dan wanted to persevere. After that our troubles were minimal so we rode around the South, taking in the miserable sites of baby monkeys chained up for photos, and the nicer sights of Rawai beach.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/road.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nIt was a much easier road than this where we crashed\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/chains.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nI took this from the back of the moped, so it's kind of hard to see the 2 baby monkeys chained up for tourist photos\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/beachstack.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThis beach at the south of Phuket was lovely\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nEveryone told us the only way to travel in Phuket is by moped. Taxis rip you off, as do tuk tuks and it's far too hot to walk everywhere (and if you were like us, there wasn't really anywhere within walking distance). So in this case, everyone was right. With your own transport you can wander anywhere you like, and stop anywhere you like. It's kind of terrifying but once you've figured it out and had your first crash it's not so bad. I would have happily spent another couple of days in Phuket with a moped.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nPhuket has some beautiful parts, and unfortunately we only started discovering them on our last morning. More importantly, it has access to a lot of other very spectacular scenery. It grew on me as time went on, and the moped was fun. Compared to Bali, none of the towns are as pretty as Ubud, but Bali didn't have anything quite as beautiful as Phang Nga Bay. It's an interesting place. And as such, I leave you with 2 'interesting' images.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/phuket/billboard.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe island is absolutely covered in these shooting range billboards.

My friend Darren lived there for 6 months and gave me a to-do list. I think we achieved everything in our one day (two nights) stay.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nReception told us to walk to Marina Bay, which is the bit you see if Google Image search Singapore. It was a little longer than the stated 15 minutes (about 4x longer) but we didn't mind as our route took us through the rather bizarre, and very spacey, Suntec City. I'm not sure what Suntec City is for, but it seems to be a lot of fancy glass and chrome buildings with lovely lobbies, around an elaborate monument rather ostentatiously called the Fountain of Wealth. Some of these buildings were so fancy that they seemed to air condition the air outside the front door. I'm sure that's expensive but they probably don't mind as they clearly make lots of money in the 'being made from glass and chrome and looking futuristic' industry.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/singapore/wealth.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nIt just seems a bit much to call it The Fountain of Wealth\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/singapore/merlion.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nOur first Marina Bay stop was the Merlion. I was familiar with the Merlion as I had taken the time to Google Image search 'Singapore' before our trip. It's not as big as it appears. We grumpily elbowed our way through lots of annoying photo-taking tourists so we could take some photos.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>Luckily I managed to elbow enough tourists out of the way so I could take my important photo\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nMarina Bay Sands is famous to me, because Darren knew a guy with a guest pass and got to go up to the incredible rooftop infinity pool. I asked him to hook me up with a guest pass but he explained he hadn't actually lived in Singapore for a number of years. Selfish. Marina Bay Sands is a hotel with three towers and what looks like a boat across the top. He, and my cousin Frances, both said to just go up anyway and have a look even though you can't use the pool. I thought this meant you could at least see the pool, and the garden, but not so. You pay your $20 (this was before we found out the exchange rate between Aussie and Singapore dollars is 1:1, a devastating discovery) and look at Singapore from a very tall viewing deck. You can't even see the pool or garden. Even though the thing you're meant to going up to is called 'Sky Garden'. They would be better off calling it 'Sky urban garden that will realistically only fit some nice decking'. It didn't even have a bench. I'm done with tall buildings now. Never again. Every city looks the same from a tall building.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/singapore/marinabaysands.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/singapore/marinabaysandsdeck.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nAs roof decks go it was ok\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nBeyond the Marina Bay Sands is the Bayside Gardens and these are wonderful. They feature Super Trees, which are big metallic tree-like structures, that have plants growing up them. Unsurprisingly you can pay to go up to the top and walk around a linking pathway. Since the thing I wanted to look at was the trees and the linking pathway, I didn't bother.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/singapore/bayside.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe gave up on walking after that. The temperature was 31 degrees and there was an underground train that would take us to Smith Street, which has lots of wonderful street food. Which we completely avoided and ate lunch in a clean looking salad place that had a certificate of hygiene on the window.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOrchard Street is a big fancy shopping street with too many malls. We made use of the air conditioning.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      Our last stop was Little India. This is a rather more realistic looking district of Singapore. While I can appreciate the rustic charm to an extent, I'd much rather the shiny spacey looking parts.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/singapore/littleindia.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>Singapore is my favourite Asian city so far. It's more expensive than Melbourne, but that's what you pay to live in white, glass and chrome. They offset all the buildings with a huge amount of trees and greenery. I've never seen anything quite like it. I'd quite happily live there if it weren't for the heat.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

It seems such a waste to throw them away.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>So we invited our Melbourne friends round on our last night and gave them all our half empty bottles. Our plan was to use up the remaining food and serve them a questionable casserole but in the end we decided baked beans, bananas, muesli and a jar of Sweet and Sour sauce wouldn't be very appetising.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We booked a taxi to the train station for the morning to begin our journey to Singapore. The next day I was trying to take a moment to sadly leave our empty flat, and close the door with a poignant tear, but this was short lived. The taxi didn't arrive. We waited twenty minutes before Dan ran out the main road to try and hail one. He was having no luck so I called upon my friend Ruth in a panic. \"Use Uber!\" She suggested. Unfortunately I didn't have Uber installed on my phone, didn't have Internet anymore, and had no idea how to use it. Luckily Ruth just did it for me and the taxi the whole way to the airport (we were now late) ended up only costing $2 less than a taxi to the station and the absolute racket that is the Melbourne Sky Bus to the airport.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So now we're in Singapore and I'm wide awake at 6am because they're 3 hours behind.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>After this we go to Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Chicago (for a wedding), Guatemala, Mexico and Cuba.

It's roughly four hours total driving to the 12 Apostles, but it took us seven because we kept stopping. I tried to keep everyone on track, reminding them about nightfall, pointing at my watch and getting agitated but they were all too busy enjoying the beautiful scenery to pay me any attention. It was only when I said the toilets at the Twelve Apostles visitor centre might close at 5 that we got some movement.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/greatoceanroad/ocean.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nIt's some ocean\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nEn Route we saw the Lighthouse from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103529/\" target=\"_blank\">Round the Twist</a>. I only know this, because our guide last year told us. He also told us that it wasn't a great lighthouse, as they go, so we're better off going to a different one and pretending it's the one from Round the Twist. We spent many minutes trying to remember anything about Round the Twist other than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPxJ6RR40ZU\" target=\"_blank\">the theme song</a>, and Dan reckons there was an episode with a ghost in the toilet.

Last year we saw some furry lumps at the very tops of the trees. This year we saw about 9 koalas, one mother and baby, and one at head height. Even I found it difficult to point at my watch as we all gathered around the gum tree, inches from his little furry hands. I still did though. Because I'm relentless.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/greatoceanroad/koala.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/greatoceanroad/stacks.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nOnly 8.

You can imagine the devastating disappointment of arriving, walking the 1.5km to the viewing deck, and only counting eight limestone stacks. No amount of cuddly koalas can compensate for four missing stacks of rock.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>For us it didn't matter, because all we really cared about were the koalas.

It sounds weird, but so delicious. We figured that chicken crisps are basically like eating a roast dinner because it's chicken flavoured potato. We didn't have any actual dinner on the horizon so we ate a lot of them.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KPxJ6RR40ZU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n    <p>Ever listen to the lyrics?

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWhen I lived in Galway I'd often drive across the width of Ireland to Wicklow for the weekend. It was lengthy and boring. What I didn't realise was that there's no such thing as a long drive in Ireland. Australians wouldn't think twice about 2.5 hours Galway to Dublin. In fact, last year when Dan and I visited Melbourne, some family friends of his offered to drive 2 hours to see us for tea in the airport before we left. Australia is so vast that driving here becomes negligible, unless you're going to say, Darwin.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nDue to some unfortunate circumstances, the friends in question (Myriam and Robert) couldn't meet us in the airport after all. So this time, we embraced the Australian mindset and drove 8 hours to Adelaide, stopping in Stawell to visit them.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/melbourneadelaide.png\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nAustralia is no joke\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nStawell is a little mining town surrounded by scenery. The most notable scenery is The Grampains, a national park featuring a series of mountain ranges and many kangaroos. It was very exciting the first time I saw a kangaroo but you soon realise that they're everywhere and don't do much.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/kangaroos.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nAbout 50 blurry and distant kangaroos\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/grampianspeak.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nGrampians lookout\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/mine.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThere's a viewing point where you can watch what's going on at the top of the mine. Lots of machinery and activity. I actually rather liked this view for some reason. Industrial.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/hosts.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nMyriam and Rob who gave us food, a bed and showed us all around Stawell\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThat night they brought us out to dinner. My mother would be so ashamed of me, because we made a huge etiquette blunder. The first time we went to a bbq in Australia, she rang me to say \"Make sure you bring something. This is what Australians do. They bring things. MAKE SURE YOU BRING SOMETHING.\" This time I knew the etiquette so went to select the finest wine. Since I know nothing about wine, I had to ask what a fine wine actually was. But we forgot it. We forgot everything. We had nothing. And they wouldn't let us pay for dinner. So now I feel bad and my Mum is going to be cross when she reads this.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/whitewine.png\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThis is the extent of my wine knowledge.

The Big Things are sculptures, often of fruit and animals dotted around Australia. In skimming the Wiki article I just linked I realised we've actually seen a couple already without even knowing, including the Big Purse in Melbourne and the Big Miner in Ballarat. Pity I didn't read that article sooner or I could have given a greater purpose to my time here.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Anyway, the point of that was the Giant Koala in Dadswell Bridge. 14m tall and terrifying. I gave it a hug. </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/giantkoala.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n      It will haunt your dreams\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nA bit further on is Little Desert. I'd asked Myriam and Robert the closest we could get to 'outback'. They kindly explained that we weren't in the Northern Territory, but there was a place called Little Desert National Park nearby that was sort of outbacky. It was, I guess. Not orange enough for my liking, but rather pretty and rugged once you got in a bit. Also full of kangaroos.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/littledesert1.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/littledesert2.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nMore kangaroos\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nYou don't really drive into Adelaide, you kind of roll down the hill for 25 minutes, alongside enormous cargo trucks with hopefully powerful brakes. The descent and ascent to and from Adelaide was our little Micra's greatest test and I'm delighted that it passed. We met my cousin Frances and her boyfriend Rob upon arrival and ignored all attempts at conversation and civility until they found us some burgers to eat. They showed us the city centre, which is much like any other city centre, though bigger than Australians lead you to believe. I've had it with city centres at this stage, so was happy that Frances's plan for our one full day in Adelaide involved no actual Adelaide.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nShe brought us to a waterfall that had wild koalas and an orange-coloured cave. On a 'How Australian is this' scale I'd give it a 7. I'm deducting 3 because we didn't get attacked by any crocodiles, sharks, spiders or snakes. If anything I felt a bit TOO safe.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/adelaidecave.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nOrangey cave\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/adelaideinnercave.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nInside the orangey cave\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/koalatree.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThere is a koala in there somewhere\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/adelaidewaterfall.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nWaterfall\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nNext stop was a Very Tall Thing, this time a mountain summit, so we could see Adelaide from high up. This was 1pm and everyone was hungry so it was decided that we'd eat first at the base of the summit. Rob asked his satnav how to get to the cafe at the base and the satnav, lacking altitude knowledge, brought us OVER the mountain peak. \"We're going pretty high for the base of the mountain no...?\" We asked helpfully from the back of the car. Eventually we all had to agree that we were, in fact, at the summit. There was no denying it. A brief discussion took place about whether or not we should just look at the mountaintop stuff before eating. No one is interested in scenery when they're hungry so we drove all the way back down and spent the next two hours in the cafe, missing all the mountaintop stuff completely.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/stawell/summit.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>Not to worry though, because Dan and I swung by the summit on our way back to Melbourne the next day. We were disgusted to see Pay and Display machines. Three dollars?! We basically saw the view from the car yesterday! Nonetheless we grumpily rummaged through pockets and wallets trying to assemble the extortionate fee. 2.20 was all we had so we compromised and took turns sitting in the car while the other ran up to the viewing point. Romantic.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe only remarkable thing about our 8 our drive back was that the Giant Koala had glowing red eyes but unfortunately we didn't get a picture.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

She's been here about a week and I won't leave her alone. She just wants to sleep but no, there I am, in the car, bringing her on another roadtrip.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur finest adventure to date was Sovereign Hill. Not only did we have a whale of a time, but I also learned to spell sovereign which is great for all those nineteenth century monarchy novels I'm going to write.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nSovereign Hill is a recreated nineteenth century mining village, which sounds like the most boring roadtrip imaginable. It is fantastic. I've never been shy about my distaste for museums, but Sovereign Hill is not looking at a mining village in a glass box. It is a beautiful mining village. When I was about 10 I went on a school trip to Bunratty Castle and theme village. Ever since I've had an aversion to costumed-up theme actors. \"We all know this isn't the 1800s. Why can't we just look at the castle.\" (I absolutely had to Google what era the Bunratty Folk Park was supposed to be). But in Sovereign Hill even the theme actors were good. They were committed and full of interesting knowledge.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/sovereignhill/bridge.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/sovereignhill/shop.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      We panned for gold in the river and found nothing until two friendly kids showed us everything we were doing wrong. With their help we found a single miniscule gold flake. They couldn't believe their luck when we said they could keep it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/sovereignhill/gold.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/sovereignhill/school.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>School tours have come on a bit since Bunratty. Here they had an option to spend the day in the Sovereign Hill school, learning what the kids would have learnt, with a rather severe (good actress) teacher. We assumed the kids were all actors too but no, they got to be part of the whole setup.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n  <p>\r\n    The real highlight was the mineshaft tour. I love an underground tour, almost as much as I love a Very Tall Building. It was pretty chilly, but we got to walk around lots of tunnels and see all the old machinery they would have used. We only went a fraction of the depth that they did of course. The village is very authentic but it wouldn't do have an ever-accumulating pile of dead tourists.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n  <img src=\"../static/img/sovereignhill/machinery.jpg\">\r\n  <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThis is not the mineshaft, but is some outside machinery associated with it\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI give Sovereign Hill an 8/10. I deducted two points because in the canteen I specifically asked if I could put the milk in the tea myself. She took this to mean \"fill at least half of the cup with milk and hand it to Anthea\". The boiled milk was so revolting that it almost ruined my whole trip. Dan and Laura eventually calmed me down, and when a second less horrific cup of tea was sourced I managed to still enjoy the day.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

This meant it wasn't the beautiful alpine ski village I'd always dreamt of. In fact, you can't really stay on the mountains. This is handy to know if you're booking (we didn't know.

However I have never in my life encountered a hobby with such a huge amount of apparatus and organisation. We went to the ski shop to get fitted for over trousers, jackets, gloves, ski boots, skis, poles and glasses. You then carry or wear all this onto a half hour bus, walk into a big room in your ski boots, which tilt your legs forwards and make you look funny and feel horribly uncomfortable. You wait around, being organised, carrying skis, dropping skis, then trudge up a big hill and learn how not to fall for a few hours. Initially I hated it. I was already planning to go home after lunch. When we got to slide around the beginner slope, narrowly avoiding the hoards of children who would be better placed on the ultra advanced slope, I enjoyed it. For the 2 minutes that I slid down. Then you queue up for ten minutes to go on a very slow travelator back to the top. I'd say 20% of my day was spent skiing. But I didn't hate it, so take that everyone who told me otherwise.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

On our first day we didn't have much time but Richard and Heidi brought us out to a beach that has a very famous split rock. They told us that this rock features in tourism posters everywhere, and of course I had never seen it before. However since going to see this rock (which was very nice) I've seen it in every airport, every New Zealand tourism ad, every brochure, every poster. They weren't wrong. So I'm very pleased I got to see in person and get a really rubbish photo because it was getting dark and we can't use cameras properly.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/motueka/splitstone.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nMajestic photography\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThey had us sleep in the shed, which sounds dubious until you see the shed (pictured below). So in fact, they made us sleep in a Harry Potter film set. Absolutely delightful. It was no picnic getting up to go to the outdoor toilet at 2am in minus temps but. I'm glad I did however because I got to see the most spectacular starry sky I've ever seen. Obviously I don't have a photo of it, because if I can't take a photo of a rock at dusk I obviously can't take a photo of the night sky. It looks like a sci-fi film where they're on another planet and for some reason are now IN the sky. Incidentally the following night my uncle set up a telescope and showed us the rings of Saturn. It looks like a picture in a science book. It actually looks like those pictures. I'm not sure what I expected, but I was amazed and delighted.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/motueka/thanos.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThis is exactly what the night sky in Motueka looks like\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/motueka/stairs.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      Unfortunately the following day, Tall John had to get a plane back to college in the middle of the day and no one could drive us around sightseeing. They were kind (and brave) enough to lend us their Hi Ace van and gave us instructions to drive over a massive mountain up to the North-most peak of the Southern island. The drive was windy, steep and treacherous and after about half an hour I was really jealous that I'd told Dan to drive instead of me.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/motueka/windyroad.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/motueka/view.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nEventually we got to Wharariki beach. We pulled into the carpark, avoiding the inexplicable peacocks and horses wandering around, and began the arduous twenty minute trek across hills and sand, to find this waiting for us:\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/motueka/beach1.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/motueka/beach2.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIn the two hours we were there, we probably saw a total of ten other people. The weather was cold, I grant you, but it was the winter holidays and it's so beautiful. I couldn't understand. Was there a shark warning I was unaware of? We didn't see any sharks. Just... BABY SEALS. My uncle had told me that if you're patient and stand near them on the beach, sometimes they'll come up out of the little pools and play with your feet. We got locked in a battle of wills with the one other couple on the beach, each wishing the other would just get bored and move off because the seals were never going to approach with that annoying other couple there. They won, mainly because we knew we had to get the van back before dark.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/motueka/seals.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nSo cute\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/motueka/cave.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>Further along the beach there are some magnificent caves, where Regelus Black (Harry Potter spoiler) may have swapped the fake horcrux. These were proper meandering beach caves, with hollows and tunnels and terror if you got caught in high tide.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nPartly because we completely misjudged the time, and partly because I insisted on driving back and drive like a granny on tranquilisers, we were late. Family assumed us dead, and more importantly, van toppled over the edge of the mountain. Luckily Heidi maintained a tiny bit of hope and hadn't thrown away the delicious dinner she cooked us.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

On a Saturday, which was our only day, there's a large underground market in a carpark where I finally managed to buy gloves. Hands now snug, we purposely marched forward to go up another Very Tall Thing. This time it was a funicular rail up a large hill with some nice botanic gardens.

This was the apparently famous Te Papa museum which to its credit has a huge variation of stuff, including a timeline of controversies in NZ's history. Dan spent many hours looking through the history of Air New Zealand section and on my third run of the exhibits I noticed a lot of people queuing. I peered past the first person into a fake plane cabin where everyone had a virtual reality headset. I didn't even care what they were showing on it, it could have been a virtual geology lesson, they were using Occulus Rifts. I had to try one. I wrenched Dan away from a really boring display about a really boring pilot who was born in a really boring place in a really boring year and we took our places. Suddenly a woman appeared and said to the man IN FRONT OF US, 'I'm sorry but we can't accept any more people for today. Sorry everyone.'

Here's my number one tip for aspiring travellers: Plan Everything. Do not assume you'll 'recognise it when you get there'. Do not assume transport will be easy. Do not assume you don't have to book it. Do not assume it will actually be open. Check the weather. While many of these affected our New Zealand trip, today we will be dealing with 'Do not assume you don't have to book it'.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe drove from Auckland to Hobbiton via every possible backroad courtesy of an unchangeable setting on the satnav. We made great time, arriving at 1 in the afternoon. Hobbiton first, we thought, onto the wildlife park to see kiwis, then some hot springs, drive around Rotorua, then go to the hotel.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n'Did you book?' The stern lady behind the counter asked us. Of course we didn't book. 'You have to book. We have spaces left on one tour, at half three'.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThis was certainly a pickle, is not how we phrased it at the time. Figuring we couldn't miss Hobbiton, we signed up for the 3.30 tour. Driving to any of our other destinations would have meant a 40 minute drive there, a few minutes to look around, and a forty minute drive back, so we just ate a very prolonged sandwich and went back to Hobbiton.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nHobbiton itself is genius. The set for The Shire in Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit was built in part of a very hilly 1200 acre field belonging to a farmer. A set scout found it, and asked if they could use it. The farmer, seeing a load of cash in his future, obviously obliged. Peter Jackson then got the army to build a road through the field so they could all build and access the set. Now the clever bit is that the farmer owns the field with the road, and there's no other access point. So if you could somehow get to actual Hobbiton (the area with the Shire set) you could go for free. But the road is on private land. So he set up a little hut and charges people 75 dollars a go. 1pm on a Wednesday and the place had only 2 spaces left for the entire day. That farmer is doing well in life.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI've been to the Harry Potter studios and was expecting something similar; props, wooden fronts with nothing behind them, halves of huts, huge gaps for CGI. Hobbiton is nothing like that. You are actually in The Shire. For The Hobbit, they built the whole Shire properly. All of the hobbit holes are accessible (though you can only go into one, and it contained a broom and some folding chairs). They're varying heights for perspective reasons during filming and the amount of detail is immense. Peter Jackson had people tread one of the little paths every day because he figured realistically it would have footprints. The path features for about 2 seconds of the film. All these little touches aren't casually noticable, but presumeably they really add to the authenticity as a whole.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/rotorua/hobbitonclothesline.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/rotorua/hobbiton.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/rotorua/hobbitonhouse.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      The tour ends in the Green Dragon pub where you get a free beer. It's adorable (the pub, not the beer). A fully functioning Middle Earth tavern. They do functions there. That would be an epic (and epicly expensive) wedding reception.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/rotorua/greendragon.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n      A handy leaflet told us about Hell's Gate, a hot spring spa, just outside Rotorua. I say a handy leaflet told us. If we had done any planning, we could probably have found this on the Internet (though not New Zealand hotel Internet while is invariably awful). It opened late which was particularly handy given the earlier fiasco. You put on your swimsuit outside, at night, in freezing cold weather, and sit in a natural sulphur mud pit. The weather was so cold that the paths kept icing over. The mud pit is hot which is a relief, but smells of sulphur. I could deal with the smell, all of Rotorua smells of sulphur, but my eyes couldn't and I had a horrible reaction to it. The twenty minutes I spent there before my eyes couldn't take it anymore were enough to ensure I smelled of sulphur for the following four days. It doesn't matter how much you shower. The only thing that gets rid of the smell is time. My friend Fran, experienced in the matter of sulphur pits, told me to bring clothes I could throw away. I did, but in the end couldn't face throwing them away so carried a suitcase full of sulphuric jumpers all through NZ and back home.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe next morning we asked reception how the weather was for our impending drive to Wellington. The nice man looked it up and said: 'I'm afraid all roads all closed.' ALL ROADS. There wasn't ONE ROAD that could get us from Rotorua to Wellington. Coastal roads? No. Nothing. We had to get rid of the hire car somehow so ended up driving all the way back to Auckland and flying to Wellington.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI read a book a few years ago which I highly recommend to everyone called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Last-Chance-See-Douglas-Adams/dp/009953679X\" target=\"_blank\">Last Chance to See</a> by Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine. They go around seeing critically endangered animals. It's rather sad but a really interested and entertaining read. The one animal that particularly fascinated me was the Kakapo in New Zealand which you can <a href=\"http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/kakapo\" target=\"_blank\">read about here</a>. It's big, plump, cute and flightless and there were loads until humans came in and ruined everything. In 2009 Stephen Fry and Mark Carwardine went and revisited as many as they could in a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1409667/\" target=\"_blank\">TV show of the same name</a>. The breeding programme had gotten the population up to about 120 which is still devastating. Anyway, the point of all this is that I really, really wanted to see one but we completely ran out of time. On the way back to Auckland we stopped in a bird sanctuary and did get to see kiwis and similar looking birds called Keas and Kakas, the latter being smarter than a chimp, which was nice. Kiwis are nocturnal so unless you go at night it's not very spectacular. They're very cute though.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/rotorua/kakapo.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/rotorua/spring.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>While driving back through Rotorua we stumbled upon some natural sulphur springs. These are pretty spectacular hot bubbling mud pits, that put you in mind of medieval witches making spooky prophecies. They probably didn't come here though because even medieval witches don't want to smell of sulphur all the time. My advice would be to skip bathing in them and just look at these ones instead.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

The plan being to drive from Auckland to Wellington, stopping off for a few different things. From Wellington we would fly to Nelson where we would be picked up by my aunt and uncle for 2 days of family fun in Motueka. After that, fly to Queenstown (they did not take my hints that they should drive us 7 hours to Queenstown) for skiing.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n  <p>\r\nWhen we arrived in Auckland it was dark and raining torrentially. Compared to Melbourne it was also freezing cold (about 6 degrees). Our new sat nav led us safely to our B&B in a charming little suburb with a large hill called Mt Eden nearby. We were hungered, as all we had eaten was a McDonalds upon our arrival. We better eat something healthy to counteract that McDonalds, we told each other, scanning the restaurant-filled street for a salad bar. It is raining a lot though, Dan pointed out, and that Pizza Hut is right across the road. It happened. I'm not sorry.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n  <p>\r\nI have friends who lived in Auckland for a year, so between them and my uncle we had an absolute abundance of... 4 recommendations. Mt Eden was the first one. As it was right next to our B&B we walked up it. Even though it only took 20 minutes I was still distressed to learn that if you want to, you can actually drive. Why even have the damn car if we're going to walk up a mountain? Mt Eden is one of New Zealand's many volcanos, though the centre of this one was just filled with grass and rocks. I'd never seen a volcano before, either dormant or active, so I was very excited. It would be a long way to fall. Or a long way to climb back up if you were a drunken teenager who decided to roll down to the bottom (I imagine this must happen). The peak offers panoramic views of the city, which are said to be better than the Sky Tower (the second of our recommendations) so we took pictures with the intention of comparing them later. The view was beautiful and the sky was surprisingly clear.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/auckland/crater1.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nInside\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/auckland/crater2.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nA nice view\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOnto our next recommendation, this one in fact from the girl working in the B&B, we walked down from Mt Eden into the centre to walk up the main street (Queen Street). There is only one main street in Auckland. It's ok, but none of the shops sold gloves, which was the main thing I wanted from Queen Street. It also wasn't Auckland's fault but the weather deteriorated to a rather grey miserable point, where even if it wasn't raining you still felt like you were walking around a black and white photo. We made our way to the Viaduct dockland area (third recommendation) and had a wander, admitting that it would be very pretty in more clement weather.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe fourth recommendation was conveniently on the docks, the Maritime Museum. Dan was delighted of course, but even I enjoyed the displays set up to mimic the interior of the immigrant boats. It's a rather good museum as they go. While I can never get fully on board with looking at pictures of things behind glass, this one had more entertaining stuff than many.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <p>Our fifth recommendation (Queen Street added by our B&B friend) was the Sky Tower. Dan and I can't go on a trip to any city without going to a really tall building. So up we went. As always, it showed the city from far away. The novelty here though was sections with a glass floor, which you have to pay extra for in Melbourne. Top marks to this particular Very Tall Building for that. If I'm really honest with myself, the view was better than Mt Eden, plus we got to see it at night.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/auckland/skytowerplatform.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/auckland/skytowerview.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nA friendly girl helped us figure out our bus back and asked us about our holiday.

Whatever the cause, Australians are terrible at biscuits. And chocolate. Chocolate especially because it all has that non-melting agent.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Woolworths divides the biscuits up by type, so chocolate, ginger, plain, chocolate chip etc. I don't know why they bother because it's all awful. They do their own brand of most proper biscuits, like Custard Creams, Nice etc. Except they just get it wrong in every way. They're too thick, too crumbly, too lumpy. Luckily they have McVities Digestives so now I've turned into my Dad. Has there ever been a more Dad biscuit than a plain Digestive? </p>\r\n    <p>One day though, I discovered... Anzac Biscuits. I would go as far as saying they are actually superior to most proper Irish biscuits. They're like Hobnobs with coconut. I'm a bit worried that they're only available around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_Day\" target=\"_blank\">Anzac Day</a>. A biscuity way of honouring our forefathers and their participation in WW1. </p>\r\n    <p>Incidentally, when you walk from our flat to the city centre you can choose to walk by a large Anzac Memorial. We did this one evening at around 6pm and a speaker bellowed at us to stand for the lowering of the flag. We stood there for about 15 minutes. All we wanted to do was get home and eat our Digestives and Anzac biscuits. </p>\r\n    <p>They don't really stock sugary cereals, chocolate bars (well there's no demand for chocolate bars because the chocolate is so bad) or crisps. And for the most part they all look fit and healthy. Maybe I could learn something from my new Australian comrades. Or maybe I'll just grow enormous from overcompensating with Digestives. </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI've been in Melbourne for one month now. As it turns out, moving to another country is quite different to travelling or holidaying. Before I left I pictured us driving up the Great Ocean Road in the cheapest working car we could find, embracing koalas, splashing in beautiful rivers, seeing the Great Barrier Reef... So far I've managed to almost completely replicate my life in Galway and we haven't left Melbourne city.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Something that happens when you move to another country is that you have to take 2 weeks to set up all those mundane life things that you spent the last 10 years sorting. And since you started sorting them when you officially became an adult at 18, your Mum probably did most of it for you. While I'm sure if she could, my Mum would help me set up my Australian bank account, it's simple not feasible. </p>\r\n    <p>Here is a list of our adventures so far: </p>\r\n    <p>-The absolute fiasco of getting our laptops delivered. For more information see my <a href=\"../post/37\">blog post on the subject</a>. In summary, they arrived 3 weeks after we did, rather than the expected 5 days. </p>\r\n    <p>-Setting up a bank account. Initially we figured we're only here until November, do we really need bank accounts? Well it turns out that if you want to do anything at all while in Australia, yes you do. I had to use my Irish passport for this (if you use an Aussie one they want a load of other stuff) and he thought the Irish word for Irish (Eireannach) was my last name. So now I have what drug dealers can only dream of: A bank account in a fake name. I'm too good really though, I alerted them. I kept the invalid debit card as a memento. </p>\r\n    <p>-Getting a phone number. My phone is unlocked, so I got free sim and put 10 dollars on it. \"Sure I'm never going to use it. I have my Irish phone.\" I explained to the man in the shop who didn't care. Two weeks and $60 worth of credit later I admitted defeat and got a contract. In fact the day I got the contract, I gave my bank letter as proof of address. The guy in the shop, being acquainted with Ireland said 'Your last name isn't actually Eireannach is it?' </p>\r\n    <p>-Getting somewhere to live. We booked an Air BnB place for our first month, reasoning that would be plenty of time to find somewhere more permanent. We viewed 4 utter hovels and immediately increased our budget. In the end it got too stressful so we asked if we could just stay on in our Airbnb place. </p>\r\n    <p>-Medicare: I was told to go get a medicare card because if I get appendicitis it'll cost me. This was actually one of the easier procedures (the card, not appendicitis). </p>\r\n    <p>-An Australian driver's licence. I just can't bear showing my pink, paper Irish one anymore. I'm one year short of expiry so I can't get the new little card. Oh also, I need one to drive. </p>\r\n    <p>It's fun though. And my friend Marty brought us to a burlesque show with witches for Dan's birthday. It was called Witches in Britches. </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI got this HP620 laptop 5 years ago. The fan makes a lot of noise, the speaker doesn't work, the wireless network adapter turns itself off and sulks for random periods and I've reinstalled Windows 3 times. But we would have been truly lost without it.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Dan and I work from home, and as such have pretty nice laptops that fulfill lots of technical requirements. We didn't fancy dragging them through Asia for five weeks, so thought of a simple solution. I'd clean up HP as much as I could, bring that, and my Dad would just ship ours for when we arrive in Melbourne. </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The charging cable broke on our second day in China, and the battery lasts for twenty minutes.<br>\r\n'Come closer,' HP croaked, beckoning me to his side. 'My time is almost at and end.'<br>\r\n'No HP. We can get you a new cable, it's going to be okay.' Tears welled up in my eyes. I wasn't sure I believed what I was saying.<br>\r\n'No my child. I'm ready to go. But listen carefully...'<br>\r\n'You can't go!' I cried out, 'We need you! We need the Internet! We need emails! Google Maps! I need to check on my business!'\r\n'Shhh,' he soothed. 'You can use your phone. But heed my final words...'<br>\r\n'Most websites don't work on my phone,' I protested but he waved away my words with the last of his strength.<br>\r\n'I haven't much time left. 30 seconds, according to my battery warning. So know this...' He paused, and finally I stopped arguing, wiped my tears and leaned close to hear what he had to say. 'You've worked with technology your whole life. You've been around computers since you were twelve years old. And you still didn't back up anything on my harddrive. It'll all be gone and it serves you right. Now... I die.' </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And he was gone.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Until we found a new adapter in a Chinese electronic market. </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Was it too late? Was the problem worse than we imagined? I plugged it in, took a deep breath and powered him on. For a moment nothing, then a flicker... And the HP startup screen burst into life. </p>\r\n    <p>HP was back, though gradually grew slower and slower. He was a shadow of his former self. </p>\r\n    <p>About two weeks later, he flashed up a new message: 'This copy of Windows is not genuine. Please enter your activation key.' </p>\r\n    <p>The copy of Windows most certainly was genuine, which I tried to tell him, typing in the installation key I had used over and over again, but to no avail. Eventually a few weeks later, as happens with un-genuine copies of Windows, the desktop screen went black. The messages popped up more and more frequently, and each time seemed to use up all of the memory, grinding everything else to a halt. </p>\r\n    <p>When we arrived in Melbourne we relaxed. Because no matter how temperamental and bitter HP had grown in his old age, at least our sexy young laptops were on their way over via FedEx. </p>\r\n    <p>HP must have heard us rejoicing over their imminent arrival because he grew even more jealous and bitter, and refused to connect to any Wifi. Folders would take up to 30 seconds to open and the Windows validation warnings were almost constant. </p>\r\n    <p>Then FedEx rang. Two days after the expected delivery date. Our laptops were being held indefinitely in customs. Apparently, though it was indicated nowhere, customs will stop anything deemed a 'personal item'. FedEx sent my Dad the form, with 'personal item' already printed, to attach to the delivery, but still told us nothing. So in addition to collecting the laptops late, and bringing them to Australia late, they were now being held and no one would give me an ETA.<br>\r\n    'So what do I do?' I asked the customs lady.<br>\r\n    'I'm sending you a form. You'll need to print it, fill it in, scan it, along with your passport, your flight itinerary, proof of address, your great-great grandmother's full medical history, the names of everyone in your primary school, a record of all your college exam results, the receipt for every carton of milk you bought in Tesco since January...'<br>\r\n    'I don't have a printer or a scanner.'<br>\r\n    Not her issue.<br>\r\n    'Just whatever you do, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FILL IN SECTION 3.1. Do you understand?'<br>\r\n    'Yes.' I glumly put down the phone.<br>\r\n    We managed to assemble, print and scan everything required and sent it to her before 4pm that day. The next morning she emailed.<br>\r\n    'There's been an error in your form. I've sent it in but it will almost certainly be rejected.'<br>\r\n    Then why did she send it in? I had already guessed the error.<br>\r\n    'You didn't fill in Section 3.1.'<br>\r\n    I explained in an absolutely mammoth email that I had done everything correctly. No reply. So I sent another email asking should I resend it. No reply. So I rang. No answer. Eventually she said 'You'll have to wait and see what customs say.' </p>\r\n    <p>All of this must have cheered up HP a little, because he decided to start connecting to the Wifi again. I apologised profusely, realising that now we were truly reliant on him. Dan and I would have to share him for our respective jobs, which was less than ideal, but a good deal better than nothing.</p>\r\n    <p>Last week we even managed to fix the Windows validation error. Some Googling revealed the culprit was probably a Windows Update that had wrecked absolute havoc with Windows 7. I Googled, downloaded, prodded, turned it off and on again but nothing seemed to work. </p>\r\n    <p>'Have you tried the Microsoft help?' Dan asked. Silly Dan. </p>\r\n    <p>So when I wasn't looking, Dan tried the Microsoft help and got the whole thing fixed in a couple of hours. </p>\r\n    <p>Now other than the fan, the speaker and the wireless network adapter, HP works pretty well. Our laptops finally arrived, after 3 weeks, and I felt guilty casting him aside. </p>\r\n    <p>I'm pretty sure he still wants to just slip away peacefully and I'm refusing to unplug the life support. But he's a loyal laptop, and I have no doubt I'll be reviving him come December, for our trip back through the rest of Asia. </p>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

All that remained of my blandest-of-the-bland pasta in tomato sauce was lumps of aubergine and courgette, two of the many things on my list of things I hate to eat. It's not the taste. They have none. But they're squishy and this is upsetting. I was in a sombre mood because I (thought I) knew that no matter how tough Japan was for food, Indonesia was going to be a nightmare.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\"Eat those courgettes then,\" Dan said. I stared at him, uncomprehending. \"If you eat those 9 lumps of courgette and aubergine I will pack your suitcase for Medan.\" </p>\r\n    <p>I'm sort of an odd picky eater. I actually like loads of stuff, and after a lot of exposure I grow to like other stuff. My issue is that if I don't like something, I just can't eat it. Most people will power through, reasoning that they paid already, but not me. I'm also weird about meat in places I don't fully trust, which meant I spent most of our trip vegetarian, or eating McDonalds. </p>\r\n    <p>Indonesia terrified me for two reasons. Firstly I assumed the food would be crazy and spicy, and I'd read countless Trip Advisor forums about Bali Belly (you can guess), secondly I didn't want my fussiness to impact Anna and James. It's fine when it impacts Dan obviously. He actually uses my picky eating as an excuse to eat TGI Fridays all the time, pretending he would eat traditional Japanese fish soaked in goo if I wasn't so weird about it. But when other people are involved I either have to pay for, and not eat, weird food so as not to cause a fuss, or annoy everyone by making them get pizzas or burgers every day. Awful. </p>\r\n    <p>China and Japan were difficult enough. We ate mostly pizzas and burgers. They provide the nutrients required to live, but when eaten every day make you cranky and give you tummy aches. I had some rice too, not wanting to be a complete cultural philistine. </p>\r\n    <p>Aside from the actual consuming of food, travel brings another problem. Sometimes, because of transport and schedules, you'll have to go ages with no food. What's worse than McDonalds four days in a row? No McDonalds. When Dan (or men in general I find) doesn't have food, he simply gets hungry. He'd like some food, but he gets on with life. When I don't have food, my body and mind start shutting down. I can think of nothing else, and if things get in the way of food, I might murder them. This does not a good travel companion make. My Mum told me before I left to make sure I eat a lot because otherwise I'll be horrible company. We learned pretty quickly to always carry biscuits, but what do you do when you think food might be imminent? You're on the brink of death, but dare you ruin a potentially delicious pizza that could be right around the corner, by eating a KitKat? </p>\r\n    <p>So we sat in the Tokyo restaurant and I ate every single piece of aubergine and courgette. A revolutionary moment in my life. Dan claimed I hustled him and didn't pack my suitcase. </p>\r\n    <p>As it turned out, Indonesia was the easiest place by far to eat. They're big into vegetarian food, and all speak English so understand when you ask if it's spicy. They usually pause and say 'No not really...'. That's when you order something else. I discovered Nasi Goreng which is fried rice with lots of other lovely stuff in it, and ate it most days. I have already written about the riverside barbecue in Bukit Lawang where I caved and ate the chicken and fish. </p>\r\n    <p>Picky eating isn't the primary source of food-based distress when travelling. Even for the most adventurous palette, you're going to be eating out every day. And when people serve you food, they put yummy salt, sugar and fat in it because they want it to taste nice. The result is 5 weeks of rich food and a sore stomach. I don't know how people do it for years at a time. </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nMy Dad enjoys going on motorbike trips around various European countries, and as such had some valuable advice to impart. Write notes on things you do every day, because you will definitely forget everything, and you'll have no semblance of a timeline. He doesn't write a blog (though I've argued it would be a fine addition to his website) but it's still nice to glance back and remember the day you bought the overpriced revolting hotdog, or settle a debate on whether it was a kindly Japanese lady or an Australian tourist in Bali who helped you when your giant suitcase split open. You'd be surprised at how utterly awful your memory is. I did exactly this. A little notepad file called 'China.txt' (lack of foresight). Since I wasn't great at writing blog entries in real-time, this proved invaluable. Also I was able to put honest details in, that aren't allowed go in published Internet stuff, like a paragraph-long moan about a persistent ear infection. You can imagine my dismay when going to write this Ubud entry, my little China.txt file had inexplicably disappeared. I searched and searched and eventually, even more puzzlingly, found a file called 'Holiday Notes.txt' but it was only in my 'Recent Items' folder, and was missing the last 2 entries. This laptop, struggling to die for so long, has now turned on me for forcing it to stay alive. 'I will destroy what you love most,' it croaks from its deathbed, 'self indulgent rants about your ear infections.'\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nSo anyway, 'Holiday Notes.txt' now successfully saved on The Internet, let us move onto Ubud.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIt's so green. If you were to scan all my Ubud photos and extract some kind of average dominant colour, it would be green. Please do this and report your results, it sounds like a lot of fun. It should be green, as it rained every day, dampening both clothes and spirits.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe four of us stayed in a pleasant hotel just outside Ubud town, and just next to the Monkey Forest. The hotel itself was actually within the rice fields, so we could see the local farmers working every day. The quickest way to the town is through the Monkey Forest - a nature reserve and Hindu temple. It is absolutely full of Balinese Longtailed monkeys, who quite frankly have their own agenda. You can buy food there for them if you have a death wish, but there's really no need. If you show any interest they'll happily clamber all over you in the hope of stealing your stuff. I argued that the large, bearded ones were much cuter than the babies. Anna didn't agree, so presumably she thinks extremely ugly hairy human babies are nice to look at. The forest had another temple, but it was Hindu this time which was novel.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bali/ricefield.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nLaying rice fields\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bali/monkey.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nI like this monkey\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bali/monkeypark.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nI actually brought four flannel shirts with me, so while it appears I wore the same flannel shirt in every part of our journey, the reality is slight less awful\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nUbud is mostly market shops and restaurants, with lots of assorted temple bits everywhere. It's charming and lively, apart from the sewer running under the treacherously broken footpath. On our first night Dan and I figured it seemed short to walk into Ubud, why not walk back to the hotel? The Monkey Forest was closed, but the road couldn't be that much longer. It took us an hour and a half, in pitch black night, on windy roads with no footpaths and rally drivers. When we told the hotel staff they thought we were insane. We did not make that mistake twice.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bali/market.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nNo section of our holiday would be complete without a really long walk, so the following day we did the Campuhan Ridge Walk. I say 'did' as if it was a monstrous feat of physical endurance, but really it's just a very green 4km walk through beautiful Ubud countryside. You get lovely views of the terraced rice fields and at the top there's a cafe.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bali/walkway1.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nDan decided to eventually embrace the fact that he always leans unnecessarily into photos\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bali/walkway2.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nA lot of green\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bali/walkway3.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nIt's even greener in real life\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe rain usually didn't start until midday so the next morning we all went on a day trip around Bali. It's not very big and if you hire a driver you can see an awful lot. Exceedingly good value (very cheap). We started with a Treetop Adventure Park featuring obstacle courses of varying difficulty, and heights. You have a harness (the guys from Sumatra would be disgusted) and you climb things, pull your way across ropes, walk on rope bridges deliberately designed to flail and wobble under your feet, and zipline. Most of it was fine, until the last, Red course. There's a part where you're on a narrow ledge on a very high tree. You have you pull an extremely heavy rope up on a pulley system to your tree ledge, while sort of hooking your arm into the bit wrapped around the tree so the rope doesn't just pull you down. Then you hook your harness onto the top of the rope, and stand, at the edge, holding the rope, and jump. The rope isn't tense. You're freefalling. The idea is that halfway down you let go (your harness keeps you in place) so your hands are free to grab the net at the other side. I watched Dan and James go ahead, panicking, fretting, eventually jumping and succeeding in grabbing the net. I stood for what felt like an hour, reasoning that going back would be even tougher, and eventually jumped. I remember nothing except that I obviously didn't grab the net because they had to let me land on the ground. I was grumpy with myself for ages afterwards.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bali/zipline.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nWe could only take photos at the practice course, so imagine this with 100x more terror\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe powered through the rain and thunder for a blustery walk around a temple in a Lake Batur, a blustery nearby waterfall and a blustery beautiful view of the lake from the top of the mountain. As it started to get dark, the weather calmed the hell down, so we spent the evening arguing outside Ubud restaurants about where to eat. We then went to a traditional Balinese show called Kecak, which is a fire and trance dance. It's in Indonesian, but you can get the general idea. The actors are a monkey army and at the end the villain kicks a load of fiery embers around the stage. Great stuff.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/bali/batur.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/bali/waterfall.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/bali/baturviewpoint.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/bali/show.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bali/hanginggardens.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nDecent\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>Dan and I spent our final night in a spectacular jungle mountain-side hotel called Ubud Hanging Gardens.

We did get up at 7 the next morning to use the terraced infinity pools though.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nEverything in Indonesia is really cheap compared to Ireland/Australia/the Western World. You'll hear people say this. I say it. Everyone says it. The price discrepancy allowed us to book a few nights in a beautiful beachside resort on the tropical island of Lombok. The problem, if you pause to think about it, is that everything is so cheap in Indonesia because an awful lot of people are extremely poor. Driving through Sumatra, while beautiful and rural, had shown us a very different way of life and to go from that to this beachside resort felt a little tainted. I guess the main issue is that we can afford to go there, but a very high proportion of locals could never afford to come here. And that's sad. So think twice before harping on about how great it is that everything is so cheap there.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nMedan to Lombok involved 3 flights, and the last one we booked independently. Meaning if there were delays, they most certainly were not waiting for us. This seemed okay at the time, but sitting in Medan airport, watching the 'FLIGHT DELAYED' banner roll across at our gate, tensions were running high. We miraculously made all three flights, sprinting through airports like we were trying to catch someone in a romantic movie. We were relieved and grumpy to touchdown in Lombok. And we were instantly targeted by a scammer.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThere were about 20 men at arrivals trying to sell taxis. This guy came up to me and asked where I was going and stupidly I told him the name of the hotel. I said we had a driver booked, thanks, but he kept insisting I needed to ring the hotel. I thought this was odd but then he made a call, and shouted 'Daniel Wilson' after us. It seemed slightly more legit and we were veering towards trusting him. He tried to shove the phone into my hand so I could talk to 'the driver' when suddenly, our actual driver, with our names on a placard arrived. Scam guy had rang the hotel and somehow gotten a name. Dan hadn't even booked the car. Our actual driver explained this is very common.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe hotel was beautiful as expected and we spent two full days sitting by the infinity pool looking at the sea. I gazed sadly at my uber white skin and figured 'a bit burnt is better than leaving Indonesia like a vampire'. That was a lesson well learned. While I know that everyone has the worst sunburn story, I assure you that my sunburn was much worse. You've never seen such sunburn.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/lombok/pool.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/lombok/sunburn.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nA harsh lesson\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/lombok/dinner.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAnna and James opted to go to Gili Trawangan, a notable party island close to Lombok, that also has a sanctuary for baby turtles. And so began the second scam. Our taxi dropped us off out of view of the pier and told us we had to pay this horse and cart guy to get in. Dubiously we handed over our Rupee. The horse and cart brought us to someone's house with an office inside. Some guy at a desk informed us there were no boats for hours, so we better pay him to use his boat. It's easy to look back and wonder how on Earth this exchange happened, but when you're standing there with no alternative information, no view of the actual pier, and nothing looks legitimate, it's really hard to know what to do. Unsurprisingly we paid him. It didn't matter really. His boat brought us to Gili T which is all we were after.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe sadly only spent one day on Gili T, and it rained. But we still saw the tiny turtles, and cycled the full circumference of the island. It was a friendly, fun atmosphere, full of long-haired hippie surfing tourists. There were lots of little beach bars playing AC/DC and the like. It was sad to return to The Hotel of No Fun in Lombok. That said, when we arrived back in our super comfy room we weren't feeling too bad.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/lombok/turtles.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nTiny turtles\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/lombok/cycling.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nCycling through torrential rain, because we like to make the most of things\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/lombok/beach.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nLovely beach\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe orangutan portion of our jungle adventure took place in another village called Bukit Lawang. We pulled up to a reception building in a somewhat normal town and were greeted with... Our luggage! Spirits were elevated. The village part we stayed in was sort of off the side of the main town. You go through the reception area and there's footpaths on either side of a sizeable river. The footpath streets are lined with shops, bars and houses, all of which seem to have interchangeable staff. It was busier than Tangahan but no less scenic. The only drawback was that we had to carry roughly 8 enormous bags up a 2km hill. We wheezed and complained until we saw a local guy carrying a fridge on his back.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThat evening we played cards in the bar opposite our accommodation with some locals and other tourists. The people were extremely friendly and would often just sit next to you and initiate a chat (they all have great English too). When we got back to our room (fancier than Tangahan, though still only had a cold shower. You think it'll be refreshing. It is never refreshing) we found we had a visitor in the shower. An enormous black cockroach had popped by to greet us. We responded with the customary reply of running out screaming, and burning the room to the ground. Eventually we conceded that we'd have to use the bathroom so Dan heroically kept guard in the hallway while I braced myself for the worst and ever so slowly, entered the bathroom. What's worse than an enormous cockroach in the shower? NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE ENORMOUS COCKROACH. We pretended to adopt an out of sight, out of mind approach. I don't like to exaggerate, but he was bigger than me.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAndre brought us into the jungle the next day to see some orang-utans. Several other tour groups joined us in a clearing, where two mother and baby orangutan groups were congregating. We watched them swinging around, the girls awwing at the adorable babies, and took a lot of blurry, meaningless photos. Andre took Dan aside and told him that because we weren't on a schedule, we were going to engage in battle of wills with the other groups. With less people around, he said, the orang-utans were likely to come right down to the ground, and eat the fruit he had brought. And so the battle commenced. We won, because Andre is the greatest. And he was absolutely right. The two mothers were semi-wild, meaning they were kept in the reserve centre, and sent back out when deemed capable. The babies then were fully wild as they had been born in the jungle. The two mothers took food straight from his hand. We couldn't go too near as the mothers can be a little tetchy and you don't really want to end up in a row with one.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bukitlawang/orangutan.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/bukitlawang/tomas.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>Onwards we went further into the jungle, and came across some Tomas monkeys. These are small, extremely tame furry monkeys who you can touch and feed. Some guides had brought fruit for us to share with the monkeys (I ate most of the fruit) and Andre made us a jungle hat. I sat for a moment, to reflect on the monkeys and delicious passion fruits, and put my hand on the ledge beside me. It was completely rotted through and, like a scene from The Mummy, hundreds of ants immediately spilled out and went all over my arm. I was promptly bitten on the hand and the sting caused me to cry out like an absolute baby. But you try tell me that getting bitten in the Sumatran jungle by an exotic insect won't make you forsee your inevitable death hours later. Andre whipped up some dockleaf juice, applied it, and the pain vanished. The stupid bite only left two tiny red dots so everyone thought I was overreacting.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur trek ended at the river, where several locals joined us to cook up a barbecue. While we paddled gingerly, terrified of the spikey rocks and strong current, they appeared on the other side of the river, carrying heaps of barbecue apparatus and marched across barefoot. We are useless.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe barbecue was incredible. I'm dubious about barbecues at the best of times, and if hosting one would probably cook all the food in advance. But I had toughened up a bit at this stage, and even ate barbecued chicken and fish. They also provided a huge platter (made of banana leaves) of tropical fruit, rice and crackers. So I spent almost two weeks in Japan eating just toast, get into deep Sumatran jungle and eat their natively spiced barbecued meats. I'm still not cured of my picky eating, but I think Sumatra did make me an awful lot better.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIt was a day for facing fears, because our next task was to tube (white water raft) back down the river to the village. I reminded Andre that I couldn't swim, but he reassured me that it was perfectly safe. The raft was four large inner tubes roped together. For safety, you hang on to the person in front of you. They have a somewhat more relaxed attitude in Bukit Lawang. It was awfully good fun though, I have to admit.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/bukitlawang/raft.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe rafting equipment did not fill me with confidence\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/bukitlawang/cafe.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThis is where we ate most of our delicious meals\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/bukitlawang/town.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe village\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/bukitlawang/andre.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nUs with Andre after the rafting.

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAbout 7 years ago, Dan got an American visa stapled into his passport. When leaving, the American customs guy ripped it out, and tore a tiny piece off the page corner. Usually this has warranted no more than glare and a few questions at passport control but Medan airport in Sumatra, Indonesia was a little different.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>The passport control man stared at the passport for about a minute, then marched purposefully over to someone else, who pulled Dan into a room for questioning. I was left standing, bemusedly, at the desk. The guy who had completely screwed Dan over grinned at me and said, 'Looks like your boyfriend's in trouble', before stamping my own passport and sending me on my way. I waited for fifteen minutes, unsure if Dan was on a plane back to Kuala Lumpur when eventually he emerged, looking pale and wan. The official had flipped through his passport several times, and told him that he couldn't let him in, he had turned away people for less than this a week ago. Dan, with nothing else to do, continually said sorry and insisted there was nothing on the page corner. I'm not sure why he let him in if it was apparently such a big deal but we weren't going to question it any further. </p>\r\n    <p>After that we paid $50 in airport tax to some guy at a desk, for reasons we still don't understand. All this took so long that when we arrived at the baggage carousel, it had stopped and the remaining bags were in a pile at the wall. I say bags, I meant 'bag'. Because only mine arrived. Dan's was still sitting, presumably, in KL. The Air Asia staff cheerfully explained that they couldn't deliver our bags to Bukit Lawang because it was too far away. The alternative was that we just wait in the airport until they arrive. This did not suit very well, as our Expedition Jungle driver was waiting at arrivals. We waited for Anna and James to arrive on the following flight, while deciding what to do. They were late, and eventually showed up displaying signs of distress. What ails you, we asked. Their bags were in KL. </p>\r\n    <p>The staff eventually agreed to send the bags, but we weren't feeling very reassured. All we could do was wait and see. </p>\r\n    <p>Andre was our guide for the whole Sumatra trip. We had booked an Expedition Jungle adventure online, which included Andre picking us up, bringing us to see elephants, showing us where to eat, teaching us useful Indonesian phrases, and generally being an all-round fantastic guide. The trip to Tangkahan village, where we would see the elephants, took five hours on mostly dirt roads with the consistency of a particularly crater-filled part of the moon. We drove through lots of little villages, with houses and stalls mostly made from wood, though many had a brand new expensive looking mosque. This made me sad, and I hate to think that's what the government channels money into. </p>\r\n    <p> Tangkahan was breathtakingly beautiful. It's a village in the jungle across a huge river. You had to take a rather treacherous looking rope bridge to get to the other side, but I'm sure no one ever falls in. We had two rooms with a shared balcony. The cold-only shower (hose) and non-flushing toilet (you just pour water down it) took a bit of getting used to (I didn't get used to it) but the room was large and comfy and the view from our balcony was spectacular. Just down from our cabin was the bar. They served cheese toasties. I no longer cared even slightly about the shower.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/tangkahan/bridge.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/tangkahan/cafe.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/tangkahan/lookout.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe following morning Andre brought us to the elephants. You walk down a little pathway to the river, and then you see a load of elephants, just splashing around, playing with the guides. The elephants, in the river, in the jungle, was possibly one of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen. They bring you down to help wash them, which I'm sure is a completely pointless exercise for the elephants but they seem to like it. Then they get the elephants to give you an elephant shower, where they spray you. I was still very hygiene-conscious at this stage and couldn't help thinking of all the Trip Advisor warnings about river water so opted not to do the elephant shower. Okay, our guide shrugged, and told me to stand a few feet away. Then without my knowing he told the elephant (Augustina) to aim directly at my back and I got absolutely drenched. Served me right.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>You then ride the elephants back up to the village, through the river. It was fantastic. </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/tangkahan/elephants1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/tangkahan/elephants2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/tangkahan/elephants3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAfter this, Andre brought us to another part of the river where you can swim. I can't swim, so I sadly splashed about near the edge. Andre enquired as to why I wasn't swimming over to the hot spring at the other side, and I explained my swimming situation. He summoned Dan, James and Anna, and the four of them heaved me over to the other side, all five of us being pulled downstream by the current. It was worth it (for me). I'd never been in a hot spring before. It's very unusual. Like a bath in the centre of a very cold river. You could go right into the cave in the rocks where the water was extra hot. Andre told me that the sulphuric water is great for skin conditions so I tried to put some in my ear to cure my ear infection. Tip: Do not ever do this.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>We were sad that we only had one night in Tangkahan, but happy that our next destination was Bukit Lawang where our luggage was allegedly being sent. So we all piled into the car again, and drove another four hours. </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

Truth be told, it didn't seem any faster than a normal train. It looks really cool from the outside and did get us to Tokyo in about 4 seconds, so I'll give it that.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe arrived in a train station the size of Ireland and walked for three days underground, eventually arriving at the entrance to our hotel. We didn't go outside once, from when we left Kyoto to arriving at our hotel reception. The hotel had a specific underground walkway, so in fact the whole 5 days we were in Tokyo we never actually saw the outside facade.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe Tokyo Pedestrian Scramble is a 7-road junction in the city centre, and must be viewed at night. The towering surrounding buildings light up with scrolling colourful billboards that no one reads, but it creates a frenzied atmosphere. Also it's that bit you always see on TV. When I was about 12, I remember seeing some movie that showed the Pedestrian Scramble junction and thinking \"I never want to go there.\" Sorry 12 year old Anthea.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/tokyo/scramble.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nPedestrian Scramble by Day is Okay\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/tokyo/scramblenight.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nPedestrian Scramble by Night is Glitzy\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nUnlike miserable 12 year old Anthea, current Anthea wanted to go to one of those skyview bars, set in the top of a huge Tokyo skyscraper. There was one, a Bar and Grill, right next to the hotel (also, apparently only accessible from under the ground). We traipsed into the elevator on our way back from some sightseeing, to see if we could pop by that evening. We were joined in the elevator by a group of girls dressed in floor-length ball gowns, and two men in tuxedos. There were two men on the door who took one look at our practical, sturdy jackets, threadbare runners and 'I've been on lots of trains today' hair and dismissed us. We tried to explain that we could come back later with less practical jackets, and more refined hair, but he refused to even entertain the idea and we were ushered back into the lift. Happily though, before we left I managed to get into a few background photos of the glamorous elevator group, practical jacket and all. Our dreams were shattered, though Trip Advisor told us that the staff were rude, and it cost 80 euro for a steak, with no chips.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nA couple of days later we realised that there was a bar right across from it, on the same floor, with no dress code. They let us in no problem, and apart from giving us a piece of unwanted gelatinous vegetable with our drinks, and charging us for it, they were perfectly lovely. We were among the last people in the bar so they even brought us to all the best spots (that you usually have to book) to show us the finest view.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/tokyo/skybar.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nSome well meaning Trip Advisor advice told us you could sometimes see Mount Fuji from a lake called Lake Ashi, and that it was a generally lovely place to visit.

At this stage we'd sort of forgotten why we were going, and what we were meant to see, but the cable car dropped us at a building so we went inside. It had a really great buffet and was warm. Unfortunately we couldn't stay there forever so we got another cable car back down the mountain, and took a novelty pirate ship across Lake Ashi. You could only see clouds of course, but the pirate ship was rather nice. It dropped us to a bus terminal. Which brought us to the bullet train. And after that we had only to get a train back. I'm still not sure what we were meant to see, but it was a good showcase of all of Japan's public transport.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/tokyo/train.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nDan discovered the 'Cold Vintage' setting on his camera, which greatly enhances this picture of a railway line\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/tokyo/cablecar.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nMy first time in a cable car.

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAll the advice on the Internet said to visit Kyoto when in Japan as it is full of beautiful temples and scenery. What we didn't know when we booked, was that it was cherry blossom season, when all those classic Japan pictures with lovely cherry blossom trees are taken. This is a big deal for tourism and when we tried to book accommodation there was only one place left in all of Kyoto. It didn't look great in the pictures, or the description but it seemed to fulfil the basic sleeping and showering requirements.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAs it turned out, it was a Japanese Love Hotel, of the chain aptly called Japaneedz. A Japanese Love Hotel claims to offer discrete getaways for couples, providing certain useful facilities in the room, and you can rent per night or per the hour. As you can imagine, we assumed we were staying in a brothel. But it was that or no cherry blossom temple-filled Kyoto.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nSo straight from a purifying night in a mountain top Buddhist temple to a Kyoto brothel. We were instructed to check in at the Japaneedz Cafe, close to the main train station. It all seemed very normal, and they gave us a really good Kyoto map. The only weird bit was that we had to come back at 8pm to get the shuttle to the actual hotel with all the other guests. You also had to check out each day (we stayed two nights) and haul all your luggage back to the cafe. This was presumably so other guests could use your room at an hourly rate, which I tried very hard not to think about at the time.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur first evening sent us on 50 train and metro journeys to the bamboo forest park. Our luggage handler friend from Osaka told us to go here so we honoured our promise. Our apprehension at getting the weird shuttle bus temporarily vanished because the park was so pretty. I can see why cherry blossom season is such a big deal. There's a temple in the middle of every patch of grass in Japan and this was no exception. It's like there were just a crowd of builders waiting for people to leave an area so they could fire up a new temple. The temple was alright but I much preferred the garden with all its little bridges and lakes and lovely coloured plants. It's much more tranquil than the vibrant parks in China but they're both beautiful in their own ways.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/kyoto/park.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/kyoto/temple.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nI'm reflecting on how this is my 400th temple\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nEating for the picky Westerner is not easy in Kyoto. The main restaurant streets aren't obvious and there's no big square with KFC, Pizza Hut and TGI Fridays, to which I had grown accustomed. Given the traditional vegan gelatine-soaked-in-goo meals of the previous two days I had now reached a critical situation: Almost two days and all I had eaten was a bowl of rice and the greatest cheese toastie. I was close to death. We persevered for ages, combing the streets, looking for anywhere that served chips. We were about to do the worst, and step into McDonalds, when we realised we could just stand outside and use McDonald's WiFi to Google pizza places. We were saved.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nPizza consumed we headed back to the cafe to get the shuttle with the seedy amorous couples. Who would we meet? Businessmen with suspiciously beautiful and youthful ladies? Fully leather-clad dominatrixes? It was two other travelling couples our age who found it on booking.com. So disappointing.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe hotel was a 15 minute drive through a few housing estates. There were disco lights in the hall and 'romantic' DVDs to rent. In fairness to the room, it was massive, clean, comfy and had the best shower of anywhere we stayed. Yes the walls were dark red, and there was a very strange 'romantic movie' on the TV when we walked in but you'd pay an awful lot more for a suitcase-sized room in a business hotel with a crap shower. We particularly liked how the window gave you a view of a really nice hotel. I would go so far as to recommending these if holidaying in Japan because they are a decent cheap alternative to the usual shoeboxes. We gave them a good review on booking.com.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/kyoto/lovehotel.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nTasteful blood-red interior\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/kyoto/lovehotelview.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nStunning views of a much nicer hotel\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe visited another temple in Kyoto and reached our threshold of temples. Once again you had to take your shoes off and walk around a very hard freezing cold wooden floor, and thinking back I can't even distinguish between the five hundred temples we saw. One delightful thing about this particular temple, was that ladies dressed like geishas wandered around, getting beautiful photos taken. I don't think they were real geishas (apparently you do see them training sometimes) because they didn't have the hair or makeup, and seemed to usually just be with a boyfriend. They were very pretty though and eventually I channelled all I had learned in China, and asked one girl for a picture.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/kyoto/geisha.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI thought the Manga museum would be cool, having never had even the slightest glimmer of interest in Manga. Turns out, it's an old school full of Manga comics that you pay a load of Yen to get into. Yes if you're a diehard Manga-fan, or interested in the deathly dull history of the 80 year old school. No otherwise.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAfter that we searched high and low for a nearby Cat Cafe. We walked up and down the block, as instructed by Google Maps, about 3 times before finally seeing a tiny Cat Cafe sign with an arrow. It was down an alleyway, up an elevator and through a little hallway. Not intuitive.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nYou pay to go in, and you don't even have to buy a drink. They only serve drinks, which is nice, as I was dubious about the hygienic aspect of having cats crawling all over your sandwiches. You sit on the floor on a cushion and the cats ignore you because cats are bastards. I persevered, shouting \"LET ME LOVE YOU\" at the cats as they ran out of my reach, and eventually one sat on my knee. It seemed moderately content, though certainly not happy to be there. Dan almost had some luck, and got a cat to at least stay still while he petted it, until the Cat Stealer arrived. A seasoned Cat Cafe visitor no doubt, she immediately rented a cat toy and lured all the cats straight to her side. No one else stood a chance. She deliberately targeted the cats other people were playing with and whipped them all into a mad frenzy, and basically ruined the Cat Cafe for everyone and I hate her.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/kyoto/catcafe.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nShe has allergies so has to wear clothes. Adorable.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAll the cats were rescued strays, and they told us that lots of Cat Cafes use purebred, purchased cats (news to me that there are breeds other than \"cat\"), so that was lovely. Even if the cats hated us.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

We booked a night there, in what I assume was the loveliest of all the lovely temples and began our monstrous trek from Osaka. We left our bags in Osaka station, with the naive assumption that we could solve the riddle puzzle maze that is the signage to find where we left them. We took a metro, a train, a funicular rail and a bus to Koyasan, which is pretty much the minimum we ever seemed to do in Japan to go from one point to another.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIt was four degrees when we arrived, at around 2pm. No rain, but we were basically in a cloud so four degrees of freezing mist.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nJapan doesn't like shoes, so when we reached our temple we had to take them off. This was ok except the slippers provided (mandatory slippers) came in two sizes - big and small, and were whittled from the toughest of wood. Our room was traditional with paper walls and floor beds, and a little Japanese tea table where they served us tea on arrival. I was terrified of offending at every turn and had no idea when I was allowed to actually drink the tea.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/koyasan/tea.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nI waited about 20 minutes to drink the tea, just to be safe\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe town itself is full of shrines, temples and a beautiful graveyard. The graveyard stretches for a couple of kilometres and is completely shaded by very tall narrow trees. You can climb around the crumbling stone ruins of old shrines, and walk up all the little mystery staircases (not very mysterious, it usually leads to a shrine). Dan was fascinated by the little Buddha gnomes everywhere so we have approximately 1000 photos of them. They're small stone Buddha statues that people put hats and scarves on to keep them safe. It's rather lovely really. He even found a pyramid of Buddha gnomes and was in his element.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/koyasan/temple1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/koyasan/steps.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/koyasan/buddhas.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/koyasan/buddhapyramid.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI thought the mist added to the beauty of the village, though most of the other guests were whinging about it. Four degree temps did not add much to the beauty I will admit.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe walked past every shop in the village looking for afternoon food but they all seemed to sell fish soaked in goo (I gather this is the Japanese way). I was about to give up hope and go to the Seven Eleven shop when suddenly, the mist parted and a glorious site appeared:\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/koyasan/toasties.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nIt was the most glorious of cheese toasties\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAt 6pm the monks served all their guests (there were about 12 of us in total) a traditional (I keep saying traditional, but everything was traditional) Japanese vegan dinner. I tried. I managed the rice. I hope I didn't cause grave offence. We started chatting to the Swiss couple beside us (she also managed the rice, so I didn't feel as bad) and the girl insisted we do traditional (yes) Japanese bath ritual after dinner. I couldn't really say no, as she said there was safety in numbers and I'd look weird if I refused. Traditional Japanese bath involves getting completely naked with a load of other women (or men, if you are a man), showering, then sitting in a very hot Jacuzzi. This is extremely awkward for the kind of person who changes in the bathroom stall at the swimming pool but if you look awkward you just make everyone else awkward so I had to pretend I was okay. And after a couple of minutes I was because apparently nobody cares that we're all naked in a bath together. Also it was that, or not showering for two days. I did wear clothes under my compulsory Kimono on the way to the bath though. I figured the embarrassment of wearing clothes when everyone else was naked was much better than the opposite alternative.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/koyasan/kimono.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nDan was delighted with his Kimono\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/koyasan/food.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nI really tried\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur traditional Japanese bedroom came with air conditioning/heater, though was still freezing no matter what you did. The toilet was a very long freezing cold walk through many corridors in mandatory slippers and the tap water had one setting: Freezing cold. Even the monks were looking a bit chilly and one told us they weren't really used to this sort of weather. When Dan went to brush his teeth the next morning, he met our room neighbour who said \"Ever had to sleep in four degrees before?\". Apparently instead of a heater, our neighbours had a shrine.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe following morning we got up at 6am for traditional Buddhist morning ceremony. It took place in the fridge. Dan was very glad afterwards that he didn't choose to wear his Kimono as everyone else had their jackets. I struggled yet again with the traditional vegan breakfast (suspiciously similar to the dinner, I suspect the monks were behind the paper screens eating Frosties) and we got 400 modes of transport back to Osaka.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIt was my favourite part of Japan, though if anyone is considering it check the weather.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe got off the plane to Osaka at about midnight and joined an hour-long queue of absolute mayhem for passport control. We realised there were going to be no more trains and were filled with immense sadness at paying immense cash for a taxi to Osaka. But then joy. A bus in the distance. We ran, only to arrive at a closing door.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\"Sorry this bus is full,\" the luggage handler told us. Seeing our crestfallen faces he added, \"but there's another one in forty minutes.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAt this stage another forty minutes felt like it would be as bad as sleeping in the airport (which we had been considering moments before). Obviously my expression betrayed this, because then he said to me, \"You look so sad. Where did you fly from?\" He obviously assumed we had come from Europe, on a 14 hour flight, and was less sympathetic when we said Shanghai (less than 2 hours). But he nonetheless helped us buy our bus tickets, brought us up to a shop, bought us chocolate, showed us photos of his grandkids, told us all about his travels in Britain and India and recommended sights in Japan. He was an absolutely lovely guy and gave us a pretty great first impression of Japan.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/osaka/arrival.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe endless burgers I'd been eating took their toll on our only full day in Osaka and I spent most of it with a stomach ache in our hotel room. Nonetheless we managed to figure out that the train system is impossibly complicated, the train stations are a sprawling mass of underground city, usually complete with shopping malls, restaurants, toilets and huge walkways. Sometimes you could walk literal miles around the city without ever going outside. Every station also has about ten exits so you can end up very far away from your intended destination.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/osaka/futurebuilding.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nCan never fit 2 entire heads in selfies\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>We did go and see another tall futuristic building. It was nice.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe heard tell of a lively street called Dotonbori, a must-see at night, so after dinner (I had a salad in TGI Fridays, a sad day) we went to try and find it. So many times on this trip we've looked something up and assumed it will be obvious when we get there. Roughly an hour we meandered through nearby streets, assuming we had covered every possible area. We were about to give up when I saw in the distance, a large bowling pin rooftop. It seemed like a good bet and it was. The street would be especially delightful for those interesting in Japanese cuisine, as it has lots of street food vendors, but it's still colourful and cheerful with lots to look at, without being superficial and glitzy. The Running Man is there. I don't know what it is, or what it signifies, but we got a picture with it just in case.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/osaka/dotonbori1.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nDelighted with navigational skills\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/osaka/dotonbori2.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nQuaint\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/osaka/dotonbori3.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe lady who took this had her friend create appropriate backlighting with her phone so that we were actually visible.

It's almost TOO easy to eat Western food. Impossible, you might think. But what if I told you Shanghai has a Tesco and a Marks and Spencer? I was disappointed, but not disappointed enough to not eat in the M&S cafe.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/shanghai/marks.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/shanghai/tesco.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOn our first day we encountered some top class scammers. Two girls with perfect English approached me and said \"Oooh you're so pretty with your blue eyes!\". This was clever because everyone likes to be told that, and at this point I was used to Chinese people constantly taking photos of me (although they never actually tell me I'm pretty, so maybe if my vanity hadn't gotten in the way we could have gotten out of this mess sooner). Anyway, I was delighted. Instantly engaged in conversation with them. The first girl chatted away about how they were on holiday and were looking for things to do and it all seemed quite normal until the second one stepped forward and started reciting a script. It was so blatant that sometimes she stopped mid sentence and looked off into space trying to remember the next line.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\"There is an ancient Chinese tea festival on this very week. It is very important to the people of Shanghai and...\" she pauses, consulting her invisible notes, \"today at 2pm, we would like very much if you could join us.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Dan grew suspicious, meanwhile I was still happy, chatting away. After a few minutes they would only talk about this tea ceremony and kept asking us to come with them. I couldn't understand why Dan was saying no. Traditional Chinese tea ceremony?! Sign me up. When we tried to leave they kept veering us across the road, insisting it would only take 20 minutes of our day. Eventually Dan managed to drag us both away. A quick Bing Trip Advisor search later (not even Shanghai scams, just Shanghai) returned, as its third result, beware of tea ceremony scam. A lucky escape as I felt guilty for ages afterwards that we had just cold shouldered these lovely Chinese girls.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe Bund is a promenade that runs alongside the river, and is itself a nice attraction. The Other Side of the River has some very tall, very glassy buildings, mostly housing Louis Vuitton stores. We took the Sightseeing Tunnel, which was such a bizarre experience that it was worth our 6 euro.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>You get into a little train carriage which goes through a tunnel under the river. On your way down to the train there's pictures of fish, so you think maybe it's a lit up glass tunnel, like an aquarium. It isn't an aquarium. It's a laser light show. Like if Pink Floyd had a budget cut and replaced their special effects guy with someone's younger brother who \"did a bit of that stuff in college\". The tunnel is black and projected swirly lights show up on the walls, sometimes LEDs. It's meant to give you a weird sensation of travelling through... A light tunnel I guess, but it's too illuminated and you can always still see the train tracks and the walls. Then a voice will bellow some stuff in Chinese followed by 'MAGMA', whereupon the walls go red. Towards the end he says 'METEOR SHOWER' and silverly lights zip past you, before your carriage arrives and you lumber off feeling very confused.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/shanghai/shanghaiskyline.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nSkyline Through Mist and Smog\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/shanghai/glassybuildings.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nTall, Glassy Buildings\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/shanghai/mall.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nShiny Shopping Mall\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe Bund at night is a top rated attraction, so we walked down the very wide main pedestrian shopping street towards the river. From the subway station, about halfway down that street, all the way to the Bund, the crowds were like something you would only see at a sold-out stadium concert. The street was fully wedged from edge to edge and you just got dragged with them. I imagine this is a lot easier on a weekday, but sadly we were only there for Saturday and Sunday. The Bund itself had a beautiful skyline at night, but the amount of tourists took away from it a bit (Dan and I don't count as the crowd, of course.) There's a bit of a colonial feel about the promenade, and it reminded me of London.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/shanghai/boardwalk.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/shanghai/nightskyline.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe hole in the suitcase had survived two flights at this stage but things were getting critical so instead of flying ¾ of a suitcase to Japan I decided to venture to The Fake Market in Shanghai. The Fake Market is a real market, in spite of the name, but it sells knock offs. It is quite literally underground, accessible only from a subway station. Dan is a master haggler and got me a fine new suitcase for 25 euro. Only time will tell but it's holding up pretty well so hopefully it was stolen, rather than shoddily made.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe decided to take a different route back to the hotel to collect our bags on the last day, through some more authentic side streets. By authentic I mean no Louis Vuitton shops. That's how we found an utterly stomach churning food market. This wasn't like the scorpion-on-a-stick Beijing food market, made to horrify and entice tourists. This was a real market (in a very poor area). Stall after stall of butchers stripping meat, fish flapping about on the street before dying, people handling full raw chickens while deciding what to buy, meat bits everywhere touching all the vegetables. You couldn't pay me to eat a lettuce leaf from that place. But the saddest thing was that this was only a 5 minute walk away from the glitzy highstreet.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThere are lovely parts to the city, such as the historical French quarter (albeit mostly used to house designer shops), the traditional-style centre market with a stream running through it, it's easy to get around and definitely easy to eat. However it's hard not to find the massive Dior and Louis Vuitton shops a bit disingenuous when they're so close to streets like the market above. It comes across as a veneer, trying to hide those streets away from the tourists.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nChengdu is the place to go for pandas in China, according to Google (and hopefully Bing, otherwise no one in China will know). We booked three nights there with our only aim being to go to the panda sanctuary. Dan was worried we'd have nothing to do for the other two days but I calmed his nerves by suggesting three visits to the panda sanctuary.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur adventure began in Beijing's domestic airport with our flight to Chengdu. Every time I think somewhere 'has no English', I'm corrected by going somewhere else that has even less English. This airport didn't even have English characters. Just very long unwieldy 'queues' (I use the term loosely. In China, battleground would be more appropriate). We gestured our way through then were stopped and told our carry-on, in spite of easily fitting in the little airport size box, was too big. We didn't have the communication skills to be angry but the man in front of us, presented with the same problem was loudly making his feelings known. We both relented in the end though and threw the cases away. No, luckily they let us check it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nChengdu was hot and our room had a decorative air conditioner. It reached 30 some of the days and it was a really muggy, 'I'm going to make you feel like you're walking into a wall of wet cement' sort of heat. I got burnt, because I wrongly assumed you couldn't burn through the smog.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThere's an entire district dedicated to Apple and Samsung shops. I don't think they're quite knockoffs, but they do have people soldering stuff in the background and you're allowed to haggle so it can't be that legit. Every shop has a big Samsung or Apple logo above it but it's totally irrelevant as they all sell exactly the same stuff. Outside there's street vendors selling dodgier looking phones and cables. I didn't know what to make of it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/chengdu/samsung.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n      We got up at 6.30am to go to the panda sanctuary, per some Trip Advisor advice. They feed them in the morning so you have to 'queue' to get a good spot. We started with a pen of seven small pandas and assumed this was the height of the cuteness. They were clearly young, all playing with each other, and fluffy. But as we went on we found there were actual tiny baby pandas. The ones you see in all those videos (a lot of which I realised were probably filmed at this exact place). They've suspended the Cuddle Programme where you can hold one for an astronomical fee (I was more than willing to hand it over) but I think I'm kind of glad about that. It's not very nice having flocks of tourists holding them for no reason, and apparently it's suspended due to the potential threat of a panda disease.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The pandas (and red pandas) were everything I hoped for, especially when one of the keepers came out and started coaxing them out of the trees. Adorable. </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/chengdu/panda1.png\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/chengdu/panda2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/chengdu/panda3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe met a girl called Melissa at the sanctuary who was staying at our hotel. Melissa is Australian but lives in Beijing studying Manderin. She was invaluable. She sorted our taxi back AND asked them to fix our air conditioner (they didn't, but we really appreciated her effort). She brought us for a street food lunch which cost about a euro. I enjoyed my Sprite while Dan enjoyed his spicy dumpling soup.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/chengdu/sprite.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nAuthentic Chinese Sprite\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/chengdu/chengdunight.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nChengdu at Night\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>Chengdu is less hectic than Beijing but somehow seems to have even more shopping malls. I can't imagine why tourists would go there, other than for the pandas, so an enormous central plaza with, I estimate, at least six Louis Vuitton shops seems a bit overdone. It's pretty at night though.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nDue to missing the only train out a Mountain Temple we found a beautiful park that looked straight out of Alice in Wonderland.

Initially I was rather overwhelmed with its bad points and oppressive smog. After four days it grew on me a bit and the really good stuff left me with a more positive view.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIt's a bit of a culture shock. The weird communist vibe lurks around, with a bizarrely excessive military presence, pictures of Chairman Mao (Dan wouldn't let me buy a Chairman Mao commemorative plate) and Chinese flags everywhere. As typical Western tourists we were (unjustifiably) disgruntled that extremely few people speak English and most things don't have an English translation.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nPeople stare. I'd heard this but nothing really prepares you for it. On several occasions they stopped in the street and turned around to get an even better stare. A woman followed me around a public toilet because she didn't get enough staring in at the sink. Maybe they think I'm famous but most likely it's just my ghost-white skin and reddish blonde hair. At the start I thought it was malicious and they hated my spectre-like appearance but then two things changed my mind. The first was two excitable teenage girls in Tiananmen Square asking for a picture with me, the second was a little four year old boy who came up and poked me in the arm (presumably because he thought I was, in fact, a ghost). When I waved good naturedly at him, his Mother (who I suspect sent him in to test the waters) immediately set us up for a photo. Both incidents were cheerful and deflated my previous bluster. It's a bit weird though and it's difficult to deal with.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/celebrity.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nGinger-blonde Celebrity\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThere's no Google. That on its own isn't too bad. But no Google means no Google Maps. Bing Maps (Nokia maps) must be pretty close though right? Go type an address into Nokia maps. It can't find anything. It doesn't even suggest things that might be close to what you want. I almost had to narrow the address down to 'China' before it pinpointed anything. This is particularly problematic because there are also no English maps in Beijing. After an awful lot of exhaustive Bing-searching we managed to get a rough direction to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. To give myself some context I 'Binged' Tiananmen  Square and read the Wiki page. Sometimes Wiki is available. Guess when it isn't available. When you try to click on 'Tiananmen  Square Massacre'. Page Not Found. It's all very strange.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <h3>Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\nWe went the wrong way into the Forbidden City. We walked for miles down a big street that a lot of hand waving by well-meaning locals had indicated but we couldn't actually see the city or the square. Eventually we thought we'll just take this side street lots of other people seem to be using and went in some sort of workman's entrance. We observed the entirely-Chinese map for a few minutes then purposefully marched forwards to absorb the culture. The architecture is impressive and the whole place is nice but it didn't leave much of an impression on me. There was a museum you had to pay extra for (nothing seems to cost more than a few euro) but it was full of chairs and dusty stacked items with no explanations. Dan still found the only English placard to read.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/interesting.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nInteresting\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWhen we finally made it out, the entrance we should have taken was pretty obvious:\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/palace.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/square.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>Opposite this is Tiananmen Square. It's a big square surrounded by military. I don't think I had enough context to get anything significant out of going there, but it's a very big deal for Chinese people to visit.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThere are so many shopping malls. The street just beyond our hotel had 3, all within less than a kilometre of each other. They're enormous and identical and I can't see how there is possibly a market for this many of them, giant population or not. Disappointingly I recognised almost all of the shop brands.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <h3>The Laptop Fiasco</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\nI had this great idea that I'd reinstall windows on my old laptop and bring it with us on our travels, because it wouldn't matter if something went wrong and we'd have easy accessibility to Bing and Nokia Maps. It died on our second day. Four years the damn thing held on, only to finally crumble in my greatest hour of need. I think it just didn't want to be forced to use Bing anymore. We had this vague idea that we'd buy a tablet anyway in China (because they're meant to be so cheap. Hint for the optimistic tourist: They aren't. Unless you go to a dodgy place where they won't speak any English and you'll end up with something that's entirely in Chinese). We spent our whole second day looking for a tablet and learned the following:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>-Apple is the exact same price in China as in Ireland </p>\r\n    <p>-iPads have no USB input and no workable way of getting one </p>\r\n    <p>-Samsung Galaxies are the exact same price as in Ireland and if you draw an amazing representation of a USB adapter you can get one of those too: </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/usb.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nIt's mostly in English, but if you ever do this make sure they turn it on in the shop and set up the language for you. On our way back, Galaxy Tablet in hand, we meandered into a very Chinese looking alleyway off the main shopping street. Primarily a food market, they sold, among other local delights, little live scorpions on sticks. Do you boil them first, you ask? Nope. You just eat them. Seeing them saved us the pesky hassle of wanting to eat for the rest of the trip.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/streetfood.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <h3>Cliff</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      That night we met Cliff. He stopped the lift on our hotel floor and hopped in, asking how our holiday was going. Cliff was a friendly, American, Miami Dolphins fan (hat, jersey) staying in Beijing for a few weeks. He told us he'd leave some information about the Great Wall with reception the following morning so all we had to do was tell them his room number and say 'Message for Dan?'. We did.\r\n\r\n      \"There's no one staying in Room 1014,\" the receptionist replied, looking confused. Assuming we just got the number wrong we tried again.\r\n\r\n      \"Okay, well a man called Cliff said he'd leave a message for Dan.\"\r\n\r\n      \"Nothing here...\" She started reading down through a page. \"There's no Cliff at this hotel.\"\r\n\r\n      Cliff died twenty years ago. No I'm of course joking, but that was pretty weird. We're almost certain we didn't imagine our ten minute conversation in the lobby.\r\n\r\n      The next day we dropped into a district known as Electronics City which is a huge market of electronic accessory vendors and managed to find a HP power supply that matched my old one. The damn thing worked perfectly and now we have two fully functioning devices and no money.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <h3>Summer Palace</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\nSummer Palace is a big traditional Chinese palace about half an hour by Metro outside the city centre. It's beautiful. We luckily arrived early, as we always do, before the swarms. It's more a park with palace bits everywhere than an actual palace, which is nicer than a palace anyway because there's a limit to how much palace you want to see. So it's mostly outdoors. The colourful temples stack up the hillside, and if you don't realise there's an easy path (us) you climb up to visit them all. My favourite part was near the start. It was like a little village on the river. You would never see a walkway with a sheer drop into deep water in Ireland. We'd have a nice sturdy railing and a cautionary sign, if we even opened it to the public. The Chinese are a little less safety conscious but I bet no one has ever fallen in. The village was a bit tainted by the fact that all the shops were filled with tourist tat.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/summerpalace1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/summerpalace2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/summerpalace3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/summerpalace4.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <h3>The Great Wall of China</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\nThe Great Wall of China is about 9000km long, which is a bit too much of a trek even for Dan. You can go to different sections so we (Dan) opted for a slightly more obscure one where a guide takes you on a hike up a mountain to an old, unrestored and downright dangerous part, and then you walk it back down to the restored touristy area. Fitness February did not serve me well and my legs hurt for days afterwards. But in spite of my wheezing and complaining as we climbed the mountain, it was absolutely the right thing to do. We got to the top feeling immensely pleased with ourselves and went up a little ladder into the first tower. There were stones giving way, no railings, cavernous gaps everywhere. A rather stunning view though. Better still, the view wasn't hindered by swarms of tourists because most people go to a different, less treacherous part.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nOnce we got to the restored part, the tourists started building up. I always get very annoyed about huge crowds of tourists, in spite of the fact that I'm clearly making up the crowd myself. \"Inconsiderate,\" I mutter.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nThe restored bit is also beautiful and scenic but there's something much more appealing about the old part.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nWe took a toboggan back down. It was very slow and mine stopped, causing much distress. Not happy.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nOur lovely tour-guide Jimmy (gave himself his English name because of his admiration for Chinese singer Jimmy Lin) made us stop on the way back in a traditional Chinese village for authentic Chinese lunch. No burgers here, much to my dismay. I managed to eat some rice and a diet Coke which kept me going until we found a McDonalds later that night.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/wall1.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/wall2.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/wall3.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n    <div class=\"popupImage\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/beijing/wall4.jpg\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nBeijing wasn't a particularly easy part of our trip.

Also if you're a disgracefully picky eater (me) it's not hard to find McDonalds.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

Although the judgement was snap, the execution took almost 3 months of visas, extremely outdated Australian passport renewal, injections and bookings. But the upshot is that I'm now wide awake at midnight in Beijing after about 24 hours of none or minimal sleep (I think I did some sleeping on our second flight, though felt like a giraffe folded into a shoebox) because I still think it's 4pm. Since our epic journey has only so far featured 2 airports and a very lengthy confusing taxi journey (taxi driver, as my friend Keeva warned me, spoke no English, read no English and couldn't understand our printed Google map) there is not much to report but this is the vague itinerary for the coming months so hopefully I'll have lots of opportunities for blurry pictures of nice things, partially obscured by thumbs.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nChina, Japan, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Australia again, many of the remaining Asian countries, Ireland.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nGoogle doesn't work in China.

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nDan and I went to New York for a week. I'm not very well acquainted with America, having only been to Vegas before now. I was assured Vegas was not representative of America as a whole, which is good because it's the most loud, obnoxious and tacky place I've been. The Grand Canyon was good though.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nNew York is much nicer (than Vegas, it's not very comparable to the Grand Canyon). It's very recognisable as all of television is set there. In fact the first thing we did was go see the outside of the Friends building. It looks much smaller in reality, though it's distinctly possible we were looking at the wrong building. We were staring up at it, maps and cameras everywhere, waiting for a passerby to say \"you're actually one block over\". We think this is it anyway.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/friends.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nNote: No balcony\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/centralpark.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nCentral Park with tube jacket\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      New York are currently experiencing Baltic temps. Initially I was delighted because New York in snow is heavily featured on television. The novelty wore off a bit when it felt like you were being punched in the face by the weather every time you stepped outside. It also meant I had to wear an enormous black coat that while reasonably warm, prevented me from moving any of my limbs and looked sort of like a wide black tube from my neck to my knees. Not an issue for Dan as he forgot his jacket.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nWe went to the Empire State Building of course. In fact we walked there, about 9km from our hotel. Dan's idea. It meant that by the time we got there (about 5pm, so we could see sunset) I was cold and grumpy and my feet hurt. I was also a tad dizzy because I hadn't eaten in a while. There are no seats up the top so I sat on the floor for a moment. Without a moment to lose an enormously tall man in a security outfit marched over and said 'MA'AM YOU MAY NOT SIT ON THE FLOOR UP HERE'. I sighed and sort of waved my hand at Dan to help me up and Dan said \"she's just feeling a bit unwell\". That was the wrong thing to say.\r\n\r\n    </p>\"DO YOU NEED AN AMBULANCE MA'AM?\" He bellowed, attracting the attention of everybody in the Empire State Building, and possibly many people on the ground.\r\n\"What? No!\" I became flustered. \"My feet just hurt and - \"\r\n\"I CAN CALL YOU AN AMBULANCE!\"\r\n    <p>\r\nNow everybody was staring with grave concern. I kept making gestures indicating that I definitely did not need an ambulance for tiredness and eventually he went away. I do feel like I probably ruined the Empire State Building for lots of the tourists though, certain they were going to come down with a terrible malady.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nIt was a good view though, the Empire State Building.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/skyview.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe ESB was the first of many times we would be harassed by unofficial ticket vendors who bark numbers at you for 5 minutes then whip out a credit card machine. No matter how hard we tried to veer, avoid eye contact, run away screaming, they always targeted us. \"What makes us stand out so much as tourists?\" we mused in our Irish accents, folding an oversized subway map into our giant backpack while taking photos of a yellow taxi.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur handy tourist guide book gave us a great tip. Don't bother going to Ellis Island to see the Statue of Liberty. Simply get a free twice-hourly ferry to Staten Island that sails right passed it. After we both admitted, to ourselves and each other, that we were not particularly fussed about being face to face with the Statue of Liberty, we did this instead. A fantastic idea. It's extremely easy, takes half an hour, shows you the statue, then brings you home. I had a completely wrong perception of the statue. It doesn't back onto the Manhattan skyline and it's actually quite small. Disappointment was avoided by getting the free ferry instead of spending a shedload of dollars to see it up close.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/liberty.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThe worst picture of the Statue of Liberty\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/hallway.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nWeird hallway\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/atrium.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nWhat IS this?\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThere are a lot of large, lavish, empty spaces in New York. They look like lobbies of buildings that don't seem to function as anything, though presumably there are flats or something upstairs. But then why do so many say \"open to the public\"? Because then we, the public, went inside and it was just that. A giant lavish lobby, possibly with a Starbucks and a shop selling expensive bags. These are everywhere. We went to Ground Zero and followed signs for the new World Trade Centre. Lots of elevators and cavernous hallways later we were met with another huge glass lobby. We turned a corner and there was an enormous, jam-packed food court, complete with a children's entertainer. How did all these people know this was here?! Were they all just confusedly wandering around close to Ground Zero and stumbled upon it? Turns out the new World Trade Centre wasn't even open yet so I've no idea where we were.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nOur friends Liz and Richard live in New York so joined us for some sightseeing. Liz brought us to the Skyline. I was worried when I saw her text about it as I assumed it was another huge building. There's only so many tall buildings you want to climb (one, one is the amount of tall buildings you want to climb) but no! It's the old railway line converted into a park. Delightful! A little bleak in winter as it's covered in snow but a truly lovely thing all the same.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/skyline.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nLiz and I on the Skyline\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAs a general rule, I'm not big on museums. I understand that other people like them but I don't get much out of looking at pictures behind glass. However, the Intrepid Museum is not looking at pictures behind glass. It's situated on an aircraft carrier and you can go down into a submarine and actually see all the engine rooms and sleeping quarters. On the carrier you go into all the little intriguing doors and see how the people would have lived day to day. They even had old men who were former sailors telling you about it in the helm. They did have stuff behind glass but that was ok. It was a museum after all.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/intrepid1.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/intrepid2.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/intrepid3.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe Natural History Museum: I just looked for stuff that I'd recognise from Night at the Museum. Dan read every single placard, paying particular attention in the entire floor dedicated to different types of rocks. I was happy that they had real dinosaur skeletons though, because as a small child I thought a museum meant \"place that has dinosaur skeletons\". I was therefore very disappointed on my first school tour to go to a museum of history and see only glass boxes of parchment. 22 years later I have finally made my peace with that traumatic memory.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/rock.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nThis picture embodies my feelings on museums\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/dinosaur.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nFinally.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAmericans understand breakfast. Every day we went to a nearby diner for a mountain of delicious pancakes. Each day we went the staff got chattier and by the end they brought us biscuits and talked with us (Dan) for twenty minutes about the Irish cricket team. It's called the Hudson Diner, on Hudson Street in Greenwich and if you're nearby you should go.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nI didn't think much of the New York City Library. It didn't have any books in it. Well, it had a few tiny beautiful rooms of very specialist books (like genealogy and maps, which Dan read all of. He definitely just does this to annoy me) but mostly it was a big empty museum swarming with security guards. A totally wasted space if you ask me. That palatial lobby could easily house a giant Sci-Fi section.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nWhat did not disappoint however was Grand Central Station. Another palatial building, but this time they had crammed as much into it as they possibly could. Trains, shops, cafes, something called the Genius Bar (I don't know what it is, but there were a lot of people on Apple Macs and a very large queue to get in. Whatever. I didn't want to go anyway.), many toilets (extremely important to the wandering tourist). I would have been much happier to give them an 'Optional Donation' than the damn New York City Library.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nWe looked at those shops you hear of, like Macy's, Bloomingdales and Barneys. Dan described them best. \"It's like voluntarily going to the duty free part of the airport\". We left shortly after.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nBut none of this mattered really, because what will always stand out in your mind is when your home flight is delayed by 6 hours in JFK due to bad weather. After about 4 of these hours, the Delta staff started bringing out free food. Not many people had noticed so I wandered up to get a fruit salad.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n\"Sorry, you'll have to wait until you're called,\" the lady stacking the fruit salads told me. OK I shrugged and stood back. A few moments later a man, unhappy with his airport delay, teetering on the edge of manic despair stormed up to the counter and snatched a fruit salad.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n\"Excuse me Sir, you can't have that yet we have to -\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nHe barked an expletive at the lady that generally implied he was already unhappy enough and would not be returning his fruit salad.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n\"But Sir, we need to see your boarding pass,\" she shouted after him. He was gone. But a horrible thought hit me. I didn't have my boarding pass. My boarding pass was with Dan on the other side of the travelator. I ran, faster than the wind, grabbed the boarding pass, veered back around the travalator but it was too late. The food service had opened and there was no less than 50 people now waiting. By the time I reached the top I had transcended anger and was simply a dejected slump of shoulders.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n\"May I please have a fruit salad?\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n\"Sorry miss, there are no fruit salads left.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nIf you've ever seen Office Space you'll understand how closely I related to Milton:\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/ny/milton.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe airport nightmare aside, I think New York is somewhere I'd live quite contentedly. I'd have no money though because everything costs thousands of dollars, and the huge excess of homeless people would make me sad. I'd have to get used to the locals having absolutely no filter on what they talk about in public (one of the many interesting snippets we heard walking down the street was \"And then she rings me up, out of the blue, wants a divorce!\"). While I found their openness very strange, I imagine they'd find us quite rude and reserved. But Liz and Richard like it there so it must become less abrasive after a while. Dan would have to buy a jacket though.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      I decided to get a bit fitter and healthier for my impending travels. If I'm going to be trekking through the jungle in Indonesia, it would be better if I could still breathe after walking up the stairs. There's a casual assumption in life that skinny people are fit. I am not fit, and if I keep consuming biscuits at such a phenomenal rate I probably won't even be skinny anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>So I started running. Yesterday. I have now run twice. I brought the dog, Tess, with me. Tess loves to run as she has some sort of lurcher in her makeup (among about 100 other things). However she only likes to run in bursts of about 10 seconds, until she sees a bird, or a sheep, or a leaf, or smells a pinecone, or hears a person talking, or the worst, encounters another dog. She is not a good running companion.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      Since starting Fitness February (I am pleased with the name) I have realised just how fit everyone else is. Anyone I say it to (which is everyone, I do not shut up about it) says things like \"oh brilliant! You should join me for my daily 5k run!\" Or \"Great! How many hours a day are you spending in the gym?\" Or \"How do you find the cross trainer?\" I don't know what a cross trainer is. I have not yet gone to the gym. I managed to run about 0.25km. I had no idea everyone else's default state of fitness was so high.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>  I asked my friend Keeva to write a workout routine in our shared Fitness February Google Doc and much to my dismay it was NOT \"Run for 6 minutes\". It features the words \"Cross Trainer\" so I better learn what that is. Hopefully a form of relaxed contemporary dance.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/fitnessfeb/fitnessfeb2.jpg\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "description": "Such is my desire to be in a real life detective story, I turned a pretty mundane incident with my downstairs neighbour into an elaborate net of suspense, intrigue and potentially Murder",
    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nSuch is my desire to be in a real life detective story, I turned a pretty mundane incident with my downstairs neighbour into an elaborate net of suspense, intrigue and potentially... Murder.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      Except there was no murder. There was sort of a mystery, but I think I made it out to be a lot more mysterious than it was.\r\n\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nLet me set the scene. First of all, this is my downstairs neighbour, not to be confused with Upstairs_One, late-night harpsichord mover. There are 6 flats in our block, 2 on each level. This is important because Upstairs_Two plays a part (Upstairs_One does not feature. She was too busy with her various 10pm-1am activities).\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nWe went out of a Saturday evening (not my choice, I would have preferred to stay in watching detective shows) and noticed that Downstairs's inside door was open (they have french doors that open onto the road also, as they are on the ground floor). A little odd. The next morning, it was still open. Odder, we thought.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nWe knocked, and shouted in, and even got our paw prints everywhere by actually going into the hall to have a nose around. Upstairs_Two heard the commotion and came down to see what was up, and uselessly added their own fingerprints to the scene by poking into the hall too. No sign of life, except... a load of kittens.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nLuckily the kittens somewhat explained the smell, which previous to this we had assumed was a dead body. But why was the door open for 2 days? Why would they leave tiny kittens? Why hadn't we seen Downstairs's car for the past week, now that we thought of it?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nWe called the guards. It's really embarrassing to call the guards. Unless you're staring at a blood-stained corpse in your bathtub you always feel like you're overreacting. They had a poke around anyway. They asked were they students because the place was such an unbelievable tip. No burglar could create that much mess. I thought it was one non-student and two students but I wasn't sure. I was sure, however, that it wasn't always a tip. The guards said there was only one room they couldn't open. That was obviously the room with the body. They said just leave it a few days and see.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nThen things got odder. There was no sign of life for the next day, and we worried about the tiny kittens. Then a couple of days later, the light was on in the sitting room. We snuck outside to have a look, pretending we were slick detectives, unnecessarily shouting \"COVER ME\" and diving between mailbox and hedge, but couldn't see anyone. The next day, the lights were off. Someone had been there.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nWe left a note on the inside door saying we were a bit concerned and could they call us when they got back. Next day, note was gone. But no call. The lights continued to go on and off. We knocked pretty much every day and got no answer.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n\"I'm going to have a look into the window of that locked bedroom,\" I texted Upstairs_Two who I'm sure looked at her phone thinking \"why the hell did I give this person my number?\". The curtains were half pulled and we couldn't really see anything. Inconclusive, I wrote in my notebook of Clues.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nI continued to text my musings to Upstairs_Two, who had completely lost interest but did humour me for a while. One day, I saw two men in the sitting room. I knew it was definitely 3 girls who lived there, but at least they were probably feeding the cats.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nI tried calling security but they wouldn't put me through to the landlord. They said they'd tell the landlord and give them my number but they never called me back.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nSo what happened? Girl murdered by her two roomates who then leave the place in a panic? All three kidnapped when the house is ransacked? Upstairs_Two actually involved, hence her apparent disinterest? Kittens eat 3 full-size humans?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nNo. None of them. The main non-student girl, as it turns out, had been away for about 3 months. When she came back she found the place in that type of disgusting state only students can achieve. The students had left the door open and freaked out when the police were around so were hiding from us every time we tried to knock. Fortunately they were still feeding the kittens. The mysterious men were just a load of other students who were freeloading, as students are want to do.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nWe found this out when the girl returned and came to tell us. The next day, there were 2 sad looking girls carrying boxes of stuff out to their Mum's car. Serves them right. Though I did enjoy the mystery.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

My Mum, the aforementioned Good Cook, once stood at my side and monitored everything I did. Unsurprisingly, these pancakes came out great. Filled with confidence, I bounded home, whipped up an enormous vat of batter, waited the requisite time for the baking powder to rise, and poured it into the frying pan.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Raw, burnt, inedible mess. Wildly varying degrees of thickness, wildly varying degrees of cookedness. No varying degrees of awful taste.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>  Waffles are easier because the waffle iron does it for you and there isn't a whole lot you can do wrong. That's why I own 2 waffle irons that I never use. I gave one to my Mum who has never once used it, because she is able to make actual pancakes.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>  Related: I once tried to make potato waffles in the waffle iron.

If in doubt, read the letters written on your screen doesn't work if you think the letters on your screen are wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Lastly, spelling it.

If you're going to guess how to spell it, why on Earth would you guess with AEH? Your best guess would surely be exactly how it's spelled.\r\n      \"My name is Dave.\"\r\n      \"Oh, how do you spell that? D - X - 4...?\"</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Is it just blind panic? You know you'll fail, so may as well make it obvious that you're not even trying?</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Hilariously, someone I know from college recently had a baby and called her Anthea.

Even if I don't buy anything, I still quite enjoy normal shopping. Possibly due to the \"looking at nice things\" aspect. I just really hate shopping for shoes. This might be because I have small but wide feet, like a duck, or a delicate plate set. So shoes never fit me and it makes me upset. My friend Anna has an extra standard footsize. I am firmly of the belief that when deciding on a standard, they plastercasted her foot and used it. Hence why she can go into absolutely any shop and buy perfectly fitting shoes.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>The second thing I hate is computer shopping. Sometimes people assume I'll be interested in this, because I work in a technical field and use a computer a lot. But there's a lot of information about computers out there, and if you learn it all today it will definitely be outdated by tomorrow. So I have a computer for say, 5 years, and then the fan starts going so fast I think it's going to take off and everything grinds to a halt and the screen melts. I consider things for a moment, fanning the flames down to a more manageable level while checking if the fire extinguisher is suitable for electrical fires. Yes, I nod at the crumbled sizzling mass of melted plastic, I probably need a new laptop. I make a feeble attempt at reinstalling the operating system, but I can no longer figure out where the on button is because it's all just one fused solid lump now. We had a good run HP620. </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>I have a vague idea of what I need, spec-wise. This is a good starting point. But apparently there are 4 million brands of laptops out there and each of your friends owns a different one. The absolute worst thing you can do when trying to buy a laptop is to ask a group of people for advice.\r\n      \"Definitely Dell. I had a Dell. Lasted 20 years and if you're using Windows 8.1 you can make toast with it.\"\r\n      \"You idiot, Dell are the worst. My brother had a Dell and it developed its own intelligence system. Tried to strangle him in his sleep. What you want is an iPad.\"\r\n      \"An iPad? Why, so you can seamlessly glide through a photoalbum all day and do absolutely nothing else? The newest iPad costs 400,000 euro. And sure you can get a Samsung tablet for 25c now. Does all the same stuff.\"</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>So you're left even more upset and confused than when you first decided to buy a laptop. </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>From my own experience, I've had a Dell and a HP. Both lasted several years because I know how not to break delicate electronics. My friend and fellow engineer Richie gave me the soundest advice so far:\r\n      \"Sure the only difference is the outer shell. It's all Intel inside. What you want to look for is their customer service. Dell's customer service is so terribly disorganised that they brought a brand new replacement for my faulty laptop and forgot to collect the old one, so now I have two.\"</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Dell it is.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nI have an obsession with buying kiwis. There are 8 kiwis in my fridge right now. Every time I go to the supermarket I think \"Oh I must just pick up some kiwis.\" Sometimes I pass the kiwis and panic, wondering have I in fact run out of kiwis. What if I don't get back to the supermarket? What if the tiny Tesco near my house doesn't have any kiwis?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nI don't even really like kiwis that much if I'm truly honest with myself. I quite like them, but they're a hassle because they have skin that you (presumably) can't eat. They require a knife and a spoon, and a plate for leverage. That's why I never eat all these kiwis.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nI found myself thinking today, as I looked at my 17 kiwis, I should start getting into smoothies. I'd definitely eat all the kiwis if they were in the form of a paste. I should buy a blender.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nLuckily I came to my senses with a flash into the future. 31 kiwis and a dusty smoothie maker, possibly used once. Moved to the corner to live with the two (yes, TWO) waffle irons.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n46 kiwis later I'm poking around looking for something to eat.

    "body": "<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\nUntil the age of 22 the height of my culinary talents was heating up a frozen pizza. Sometimes people say that, but when you really quiz them on it it's not true.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n\"Well can you make pasta?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh well obviously pasta.\"<br>\r\n\"What about chicken?\"<br>\r\n\"I mean, I could do a stir fry or something. But sure anyone can do that.\"<br>\r\n\"What about grilled salmon with fresh blueberry corn salsa?\"<br>\r\n\"Ah well sure I've been doing that since primary school.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nBut I am being completely and pathetically honest when I say pizza was absolutely the most complicated thing I could make. Any of my undergrad housemates can testify to this. I could pre-heat the oven, put in the frozen pizza, and it would come out. Sometimes cooked all the way through if I was willing to scrape away the charcoal.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nThen I moved in with my friend Anna whose (possibly imagined) judgemental stares finally forced me to change. She almost reduced me to tears with her silent ridicule over the \"microwave pasta\" fiasco. And rightly so. (Microwave pasta is really awful. It tastes like sellotape).\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nI learned to cook actual pasta. I faced my fear of raw chicken (though still wrap it in 7 separate bags in the fridge), and that year I made my first stir fry. It was horrible but I developed my now motto: There's Usually Something Salvageable. It will be the title of my successful short cookery book that covers 10 different ways to put chicken with pasta.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nSince then I've reached an okay level. I would certainly not be confident hosting a televised Come Dine With Me, but I manage to intake daily nutrients and not poison myself. This year I've tried to cook new things. Last week I attempted steak. My Mum, who is a really good cook, told me; \"Steak is really easy! You can't get it wrong!\"\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      I got it wrong. True to my motto, if you hacked away long enough there was something salvageable, but overall, it tasted like a boot. Much to the extreme irritation of many people, I cannot stand any amount of red in any meat. However, when my Mum cooks steak it's not red, but lacks the rubbery texture of a boot. \"Cook both sides for a few minutes!\" she said. I did and it was absolutely red-raw. It took about half an hour to get the red down to a manageable level and by that time I had successfully burned away any remaining taste. I eventually gave up on trying to eliminate the red and just didn't eat the centre. I don't know how there was any steak left when I was finished frying it, let alone how it was still slightly raw in the middle.</p>\r\n      <p>\"The pepper sauce is niceâ€¦\" Dan said, kindly. It didn't take much skill to add milk to the instant pepper sauce powder though.</p>\r\n      <p>More culinary adventures to follow.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>",

Dan insists I insisted on it in the planning stages, but I don't remember this. I'm pretty sure it was his idea. We arrived in Hobart on Saturday night and thought 'uh oh, our hotel is pretty far from the action'. Sunday revealed there was, in fact, no action. There's nowhere you can stay in Hobart that is 'central' because you'd have to actually be central to something. It's pretty I guess... It didn't help that our only full day was Sunday and no busses, trains or tours ran. We went to a free museum. Dan read every single placard. He does this, I'm sure, purely to annoy me, because he knows I can never make it through 3 paragraphs on 18th century Oriental basket weaving.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/australia/Australia_8.png\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nHobart.

It had a colonial gaol, a postbox and a bridge. Our tour guide was really resentful when Dan said he was a physicist, loudly demeaning the work of (we assume) Stephen Hawking saying 'Physics eh? Like the bloke who wrote that book about getting something from nothing? Hahaha.' Dan thanked him for his refreshing perspective but has decided not to burn his PhD.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/australia/Australia_10.jpg\">\r\n    <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\nRichmond.\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>",

I didn't have a blog then, but I did write about it. So I'm cheating and putting up the interesting bits now.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Interesting Bits of Malaysia\r\n\r\n    They're very Muslim. I haven't been to sayâ€¦ Iran, so I probably don't know what \"very Muslim\" means. But they're certainly the most Muslim country I've been to. My impression was they don't really like women, shorts, unmarried couples or shoulders. I went with Dan and it was a little disconcerting to hand a vendor money and have him address only Dan. I wore shorts to an almost empty Pizza Hut. They brought Dan his food and calmly waited for him to finish completely before bringing mine. So I set fire to the establishment.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      Buda Caves. These were very nice caves. So nice in fact, that I will be unbearable on any Irish cave-related trips from now on. \"Yeah these caves are okay. But this one time I was in Kuala Lumpur...\" Possibly why I don't get invited to many caving expeditions now I think of it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n    <img src=\"../static/img/malaysia/Malaysia_Ailwee.png\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      We were warned that these tiny adorable monkeys would terrorise us if we brought any food up the steps, and possibly even if we didn't. Psh, we thought. Bring on the adorable monkeys. We'll get a nice photo of us being friends with local monkeys. They were DEMON MONKEYS. They would watch you from a distance, slowly stalking you, then run straight at your face, grab your bag/sleeve/ill-advised can of 7UP and wrench it from your grip. We actually saw them steal medicine from a frantic Indian family. They might look cute, but they are horrible little scumbags. They also leave a terrible mess in an otherwise lovely cave.

Everything in Malaysia is extremely cheap. As such we managed to afford 2 nights on an incredibly beautiful island. The monkeys were calmer, and a little chubbier. Pictured below is one eating the food he stole from our room while I was in it.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>A warning, if you ever go to Pangkor Laut and are not extremely rich, you'll have to get a 4 hour bus to and from KL. This isn't so bad, except the station it drops you in is a town called Lumut. If ever there was an opposite to Pangkor Laut, it's the town of Lumut. Our bus back was delayed at midday by 2 hours. That was a toasty 2 hours. I tried not to touch anything. We did get to enjoy a half-hour of loudspeakered afternoon Islam prayer though.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row postRow\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/malaysia/Pangkor-Laut-Monkey.jpg\">\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        Nicer, chubbier monkey\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/malaysia/Pangkor-Laut.jpg\">\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        Beautiful Island\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n      <img src=\"../static/img/malaysia/Lumut.jpg\">\r\n      <div class=\"imgCaption\">\r\n        Less than Beautiful Lumut\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"bottomRow\"></div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"row\">\r\n  <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      I live in a flat in the worst case scenario. I have neighbours to the left, right, above and below. The right and upstairs are the most uproarious but upstairs win because we share something to do with the hot water pump. This means every time they turn on their hot water tap it sounds like someone is pushing gravel through a lawnmower above my bedroom.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Many an evening have I listened to their mysterious clunks and hot water tap activities. It's an odd situation because I have no idea what's actually going on, mere feet away from me. As such I have written a short interpretation of their events:</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\"Friend, would you mind helping me drag this piano across the floor?\" Upstairs Neighbour asked. \"I was going to do it earlier but it's always best to start this sort of thing at 11.30pm on a Tuesday. You know yourself.\"</p>\r\n      <p>\"Can you give me one sec?\" asked Friend, \"I just need to run across the floor in my concrete high heels to turn the hot tap on and off a few times.\"</p>\r\n      <p>\"No problem, that'll give me a chance to pour all these marbles out of this jar onto the floor. I've been meaning to do this all day.\"</p>\r\n      <p>\"Okay,\" Friend returned, doing a few jumping jacks on her way back to the bedroom. \"I'm ready to help move the piano.\"</p>\r\n      <p>Moving the piano was heavy work. It involved a lot of stopping and starting. After two hours and twenty-six drops, they had successfully manoeuvred it four feet across the floor.</p>\r\n      <p>\"It may not look like much,\" Upstairs Neighbour looked at the piano, \"but imagine how hard it would have been if we didn't have twelve very brief showers in between.\"</p>\r\n      <p>\"True. I'm exhausted though, need a smoke. It's raining, do you mind if I just stand in the hallway with the door open a token 2 inches?\"</p>\r\n      <p>\"Be my guest. I'll wake up my tiny child and tell her she can't have any sweets.\"</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>",

I remember that it was really busy (August) and the market was restricted by a rail, or maybe there were stalls on both sides. Whatever the structure, the result was that the only way to escape was to continue to the end. It was night time and each stall had its own lantern. All I can remember was that I was trapped in an endless river of horrific meat cuisine, the lanterns carried on as far as the eye could see. The smell. I remember the smell. I was a lot more squeamish back then! I really liked Summer Palace. I wish I'd written a blog. Maybe it's still possible, a fake China trip. Surely nobody would notice that I've ages 9 years since then. Or maybe I'll just leave self centered, annoyingly long comments on your blog, and live my dreams through you.

We don't have any upstairs neighbours, as we live on the top floor. Across the street though, there is a very annoying man who plays loud music during the night. I've given up on the 007, and gone all 0900-8844. That's the police non-emergency telephone number. We ring it every time, and two policemen actually go there and tell him to shut up. It works, but just for that night. The next night we just call them again. Exciting times.",
